Coordinating Node System Configuration
======================================
This file represents a log of system configuration that needs to be done on
the CN instances.  Many of these settings will be already done for the CN
virtual machines, but some settings will need to be changed in order to run
multiple instances of the CN at different sites.

OS
--
Install Ubuntu 9.10.  Plan to use Ubuntu 10.4 LTS release, so building off
of 9.10 as this is the closest OS to that release.  Install standard server
install.

HOST AND NETWORK
----------------
* Assign IP on local network, configure DHCP, DNS, hostname, etc.
* Create local sysadmin accounts for brand and jones, enable sudo through
  group 'admin'

PAM-LDAP
--------
* During install of libnss-ldap, configure LDAP to point at ldap.ecoinformatics.org
* Edit /etc/ldap.conf to configure LDAP to use TLS, etc.
* To enable LDAP logins:
    root@cn-dev:/var/log# auth-client-config -t nss -p lac_ldap
    root@cn-dev:/var/log# pam-auth-update 


* To disable LDAP logins:
    root@cn-dev:/var/log# auth-client-config -r -t nss -p lac_ldap
    root@cn-dev:/var/log# pam-auth-update 

Still struggling with restricting ldap logins to just a single group.

FIREWALL
--------
* To be done
