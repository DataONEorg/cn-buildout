<descript>
<abstract>
Vegetation field plots at Agate Fossil Beds NM were visited, described,
and documented in a digital database. The database consists of 2 parts -
(1) Physical Descriptive Data, and (2) Species Listings.
</abstract>
<purpose>
Provide National Parks with the necessary tools to effectively manage
their natural resources. Plot data is collected and analyzed to develop a
classification (using the Standardized National Vegetation Classification
System) and description of vegetation types in preparation for
photointerpretation and mapping of the monument's vegetation types.

The descriptive plot data were collected for 39 sites whose vegetation
represents a full spectrum of alliance types present within Agate Fossil
Beds National Monument and its immediate surroundings. Physical description
- Attributes collected for each site include: a plot number,
a unique plot identification code, community name, field name, state,
park name, quad name, map projection, datum, GPS file name, raw UTM
coordinates, differentially corrected UTM coordinates, plot survey date,
name(s) of surveyors, length, width, photo type, elevation, slope, aspect,
topographic position, landform, surface geology, Cowardin System category,
hydrology, surface material description, soil texture, soil drainage, leaf
phenology, leaf type, and physiognomy. Species - Individual species described
at each of 39 plots is listed, one line per species, with the following
information: Plot Identification Code, Numeric Species Code, Species Name,
Species Cover (0=trace, 1=&lt; 1%, 2=1-5%, 3=5-25%, 4=25-50%, 5=50-75%,
6=75-100%), Plantcode, and Strata Code (T1=emergent, T2=canopy, T3=sub-canopy,
S1=tall shrub, S2=short shrub, H=herbaceous, N=non-vascular, V=vinae/liana,
E=epiphyte).
</attraccr>
</attracc>
<logic>
Physical description - Entries for each of the listed attributes are in
the form of consistent groupings of either textual or numerical descriptors.
Species - Entries for each of the listed attributes are in the form of
consistent groupings of either textual or numerical descriptors, as defined
above under "Attribute Accuracy Report". NOTE1: The significance of numbers
appended to some of the Plant Codes is not known.
</logic>
<complete>
Physical description - Comprehensive descriptions exist for each of the 39
plots, but some do not contain entries under headings which are not
applicable, and some plots do not have locational coordinates. Species -
One species is entered per line, by plot code, with multiple species listed
for each plot, one per row. Plot codes and species names are complete for
each row, but some species codes, cover and strata information is missing
(because it was not present on the original field forms).

<horizpar>
X,Y UTM coordinates representing each of the 39 plots were collected via
GPS under selective availability with post processing for differential
correction. The differentially correted GPS coordinates have accuracies
in the X and Y direction of +/- 2 to 5 meters.

The following describes the tasks performed by The Nature Conservancy to
produce descriptive data for 39 vegetation sampling plots in two
separate database files. Physical description - The first of the two
contains general descriptive information at each of the plots. Plot
sites were selected subjectively because of the heterogeneity of the
vegetation and the small number of samples per type. Since aerial
photos were not available at the time of plot selection, visual
reconnaissance was conducted at the summit of the monument to examine
vegetation patterns for the purpose of plot placement. Site physical
parameters, species types, and vegetation strata were then described
at each site. The PLOT DATA database contains tabulations of site
physical factors, listed under the ATTRIBUTE ACCURACY REPORT for each
of the 39 plots. Plot data were manually recorded on field forms on-site,
and subsequently keyed into the database files described herein.
Information in the plot database was then used to develop the
classification system and plant identification keys contained in the
AGATE FOSSIL BEDS SAMPLING AND CLASSIFICATION REPORT. Species - The
second of the two contains listings of individual species found in
each plot, along with height and cover estimates, and strata
delineations. The SPECIES LISTING database contains line entries for
each species including the Plot Code, Numeric species code, full
scientific species name, cover estimate, a unique alphnumeric species identifier
(plant code), and Plant Strata delineation. Plot sites were
selected subjectively because of the heterogeneity of the vegetation
and the small number of samples per type. Since aerial photos were not
available at the time of plot selection, visual reconnaissance was
conducted at the summit of the bluff to examine vegetation patterns
for determining plot placement. Plot data were manually recorded on
field forms on-site, and subsequently keyed into the database files
described herein. Information in the plot database was then used to
develop the classification system and plant identification keys
contained in the AGATE FOSSIL BEDS SAMPLING AND CLASSIFICATION REPORT.

Each of 39 vegetation mapping plot sites contains the attributes of
species found. Physical description - General plot information is
described by identification codes, locational information (including
state, park name, and USGS 7 1/2' topographic quad name). Physical
factors tabulated in the database include UTM_X, UTM_Y, UTM Zone, map
projection, survey date, name of surveyors, plot length and width, type
of photos used, plot elevation, slope aspect, topographic position,
landform type, surface geology, Cowardin system descriptor, hydrology,
rock size, surface material type, soil texture and drainage, leaf
phenology, leaf type, and physiognomy. Species - Species - (sp_code is
a project specific code for  each species found, species is the
scientific name for that  species, spcover is the species present and
the percent cover for each species, plant code is the first two letters
of the  genus and first two letters of the species. If the code are not
unique a number is added to make the code unique). This includes strata
cover  which is an average percent cover of that particular species,
1 = 0-10%, 2 = 10-25%, 3 = 25-60% and 4 = 60-100%,  pstrata is the type
of vegetation, T1 = emergent, T2 = canopy, T3  = sub-canopy, S1 = tall
shrub, S2 = short shrub, H = herbaceous, N = non-vascular, V =
vine/liana, and E = epiphyte).
