<abstract>Our studies will determine how mountain protected areas along a transect from western Washington to western Montana are affected by climatic variability. Research will focus on ecological responses to climatic variability within and between Olympic National Park, North Cascades National Park, and Glacier National Park. Our research program addresses three key research questions: What are the impacts of spatial and temporal climatic variability (including extreme events) on critical plant resources and species distribution? What are the impacts of climatic variability on ecosystem processes (e.g., carbon cycling) and natural resources (e.g., water supply)? How do different levels and types of disturbance influence landscape patterns and the sensitivity of ecosystems to climatic variability? Specifically, we will quantify how climatic variability (including climatic-change scenarios) affects 1) future distribution and abundance of forest vegetation along environmental gradients in mountainous landscapes, 2) the interaction of energy and water supply with hydrological processes and forest productivity, and 3) natural disturbance regimes in the context of human-caused land cover changes. We will emphasize potential changes in natural resource outputs and ecological services, and highlight those landscapes that are most vulnerable to an altered biophysical environment. Our research program addresses all four program goals, two biogeographic regions, and seven thematic areas of the BRD Global Change Research Program.</abstract>
