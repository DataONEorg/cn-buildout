<abstract>Every National Park in the United States must produce a resource management plan every few years. After the plan is created, tactical planners create budgets and personnel to make the plan come to life. Each stage needs to incorporate decision-making tools. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is highly recommended to put these tools into place. This paper describes the results of putting AHP into effect for five management team members and eight projects.</abstract>
