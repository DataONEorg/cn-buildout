<descript>
<abstract>Vegetation field plots at Florissant Fossil Beds NM were visited, described, and documented in a digital database.  The database consists of 2 parts - (1) Physical Descriptive Data, (2) Species Listings, and strata descriptive Data.</abstract>
<purpose>Provide National Parks with the necessary tools to effectively manage their natural resources.  Plot data are collected and analyzed to develop a classification (using the Standardized National Vegetation Classification System) and description of vegetation types in preparation for photointerpretation and mapping of the monument's vegetation types.</purpose>

Physical description - Descriptive plot data were
collected for 99 sites and 60 observation points
whose vegetation represents a full spectrum of
alliance types present within Florissant Fossil
Beds National Monument.  Attributes collected for each site
include: a unique plot identification code, park
name, quad name, UTM coordinates, UTM projection,
plot survey date, surveyor's name, length, width,
photo type, elevation, slope aspect, topographic
position, landform, surface geology, Cowardin
System category, hydrology, surface material
description, soil texture, soil drainage, leaf
phenology, leaf type, and physiognomy. Species -
Descriptive plot data were collected for 99 sites
whose vegetation represents a full spectrum of
alliance types present within Florissant Fossil
Beds National Monument.
This database, which is the second of two
databases containing plot field data, delineates
species.  Individual species described at each of
99 plots is listed, one line per species, with the
following information:  Plot Identification Code,
Numeric Species Code, Species Name, Species Cover
( 0=trace, 1=&lt; 1%, 2=1-5%, 3=5-25%, 4=25-50%,
5=50-75%,  6=75-100%), Plantcode, and Strata Code
(T1=emergent, T2=canopy, T3=sub-canopy, S1=tall
shrub, S2=short shrub, H=herbaceous,
N=non-vascular, V=vinae/liana, E=epiphyte).
Most of the 99 plots have multiple strata, with each
listed as a separate line entry in the species database.
Strata are described by plot code, descriptive name,
height, cover, and an alpha-numeric strata code.
Descriptive names include canopy, sub-canopy, tall
shrub, short shrub, herbaceous, and emergent. Height
classes, in meters, range from 1 to 7: 1=&lt;0.5 m,
2=0.5-1m, 3=1-2m, 4=2-5m, 5=5-10m, 6=10-15m and
7=15-20m. Cover groupings, in percent, range from 1
to 4: 1=0-10%, 2=10-25%, 3=25-60%, and 4=60-100%.
The diagnostic species for each stratum is listed
by latin name. Stratum codes are defined in the
following manner: T1=emergent, T2=canopy,
T3=sub-canopy, S1=tall shrub, S2=short shrub, and
H=herbaceous.  Less extensive data were collected at the
60 observation points in two tables.

"Attribute Accuracy Report".

Physical description - Descriptive entries for each
of the 99 plots and 60 observation points

One species is entered per line, by plot code,
with multiple species listed for each plot, one
per row.  Plot codes and species names are
complete for each row, but some species codes,
cover and strata information is missing (because
it was not present on the original field forms).

The following describes the tasks performed by
The Nature Conservancy to produce descriptive
data for 99 vegetation sampling plots in two
separate database files and 60 observation points.
The first contains general descriptive information
at each of the plots. Plot sites were selected
by information obtained during a reconnaissance
visit to the park in June of 2001, and by
examining tone and textural patterns on the FLFO
AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS. Site physical parameters,
species types, and vegetation strata were
described at each site. The PLOTS database
contains tabulations of site physical factors,
listed under the ATTRIBUTE ACCURACY REPORT for
each of the 99 plots. Plot data were manually
recorded on field forms on-site, and subsequently
keyed into the database files described herein.
Information in the plot database was then used
to develop the classification system and plant
identification keys contained in the Project Report.

The following describes the tasks performed by The
Nature Conservancy to produce descriptive data for
99 vegetation sampling plots in three separate
database files.  The second table contains
listings of individual species found in each plot,
along with height and cover estimates, and strata
delineations.  The SPECIES LISTING database
contains line entries for each species including
the Plot Code, Numeric species code, full
scientific species name, cover estimate, a unique
alphnumeric species identifier (plant code), and
Plant Strata delineation.    Plot sites were
selected subjectively because of the heterogeneity
of the vegetation and the small number of samples
per type.  Since aerial photos were not available
at the time of plot selection, visual
reconnaissance was conducted at  the summit of the
bluff to examine vegetation patterns for
the purpose of plot placement.  .  Plot data were
manually recorded on field forms on-site, and
subsequently keyed into the database files
described herein.  Information in the plot
database was then used to develop
the classification system and plant identification
keys contained in the Project Report.

gps file, raw utm x, raw  utm y, corrected utm x,

surficial geology,  cowardin system type, hydrography,
bedrock, large rock, small  rock, sand, litter duff,
wood, bare soil, other soil, soil texture,

and  physiology). Species - (sp_code is a project
specific code for  each species found, species is
the scientific name for that  species, spcover is
the species present and the percent cover   for
each species, plant code is the first two letters
of the  genus and first two letters of the species.
If the code are not  unique a number is added to
make the code unique). Strata -  (height and cover
are average percent cover of that particular
species, 1 = 0-10%, 2 = 10-25%, 3 = 25-60% and
4 = 60-100%,  pstrata is the type of vegetation,
T1 = emergent, T2 = canopy, T3  = sub-canopy,
S1 = tall shrub, S2 = short shrub, H = herbaceous,
N = non-vascular, V = vine/liana, and E = epiphyte).
