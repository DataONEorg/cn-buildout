<abstract>Fire is a critical natural ecosystem process in many types of forests in North America.  In the Pacific Northwest region of North America, fires were historically the dominant disturbance, with intervals between fires being much shorter in areas with low-precipitation such as the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington. However, during the 20th century, fire suppression and exclusion by humans became a major disturbance altering natural ecosystem processes. As a result, fewer fires have led to a build up of fuel in many areas, which increases the potential for high intensity, stand-replacement crown fires as opposed to small, understory fires that would only kill small trees and remove litter from the forest floor. Consequently, it is becoming more important for resource managers to know where and when fires are most likely to occur, and which factors are related to the presence of ignitions.This publication studies the effects of vegetation cover, elevation, slope, and precipitation on the probability of lightning-caused fires as a space-time stochastic (random) process in the Blue Mountains. They discovered that higher ignition probabilities were associated with certain cover types, and that higher ignition probabilities occurred at lower elevations within each cover type. The procedure used in this study is suitable for analyzing ignition occurrence in other forested regions where it is important to understand the distribution of fire occurrence and associated fire effects.</abstract>
