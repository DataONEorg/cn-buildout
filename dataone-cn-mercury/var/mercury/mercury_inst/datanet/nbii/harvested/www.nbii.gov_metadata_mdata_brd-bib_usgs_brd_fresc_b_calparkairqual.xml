<descript>
<abstract>A thorough review of data and information sources on air pollution effects in California&amp;#146;s National Parks has been completed, based on the open literature and materials accessed at individual parks. Tables of data on sensitive plant species has been compiled for each park, and a draft summary of past research and monitoring, scientific literature, and recommendations for future monitoring has been written. This information has been merged with data on air quality in a final report to the National Park Service Air Resources Division.</abstract>
