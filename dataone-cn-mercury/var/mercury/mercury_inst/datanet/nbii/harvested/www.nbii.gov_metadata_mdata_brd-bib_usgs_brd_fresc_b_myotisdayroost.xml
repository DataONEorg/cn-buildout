<abstract>This paper presents data on the use of day-roosts and their spatial relation with water by female long-eared myotis in western Oregon.  Radiotelemetry was used to track 21 bats to 73 day-roosts in 1996 and 1997.  Bats primarily used conifer stumps in areas dominated by younger forests and used conifer snags, and to a lesser extent conifer stumps, in areas with greater proportions of older forests.  Roosts were primarily located in upslope habitats, were not located closer to available water than random points, but were closer than random points to captures sites.  Large conifer snags in intermediate stages of decay used were most often used as roosts and averaged 34 m in height.  Use of snags was positively related to the number of snags within 20 m and negatively associated with distance from stand edge.  Western hemlock and Douglas-fir stumps used as roosts averaged 133 cm in height.  Taller stumps and stumps situated in vegetation gaps had a greater chance of being used as a roost.  Management of roosts for forest-dwelling bats should focus on maintaining large conifer snags across landscapes through space and time.</abstract>
