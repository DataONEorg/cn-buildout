<abstract>During the last century, fire suppression, grazing, and climate change have caused sagebrush grasslands of the western United States to change in both function and form. Presently juniper and sagebrush dominate portions of the landscape at the expense of herbaceous plants. USGS scientists have been studying the effects of prescribed fire and juniper cutting on the distribution and concentration of a major soil nutrient, inorganic nitrogen. Working in central Oregon, the researchers found that patchy sources or "resource islands" of inorganic nitrogen occurred, but they were variable in location and concentration of nitrogen through time. The concentration of inorganic nitrogen in these islands increased when an area burned but was little affected by the cutting of juniper. They also found that a noxious weed called medusahead showed higher growth in burned areas than in areas where juniper was removed by cutting. This information will help managers as they attempt to restore native herbaceous plants and simultaneously attempt to limit invasions of non-native plants, like medusahead. These results are reported in a master's thesis, which serves as the final report for the USGS project called Risk of Establishment of Taeniatherum caput-medusae with management applications. The report can be referenced as Stubbs, M. 2000. Time-based nitrogen availability and risk of Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski invasion in Central Oregon. M.S. Thesis.
