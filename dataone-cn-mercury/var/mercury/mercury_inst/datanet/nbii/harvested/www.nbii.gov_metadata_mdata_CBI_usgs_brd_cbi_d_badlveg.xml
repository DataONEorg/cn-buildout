<abstract>
This metadata is for all coverages associated with
the vegetation land cover and land use geospatial
database for Badlands National Park and
surrounding areas.  The project is authorized as
part of the USGS/NPS Vegetation Mapping Program
(http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg). The program is
being administered by the Biological Resources
Division (BRD) of the United States Geological
Survey (USGS).  The USGS/BRD is responsible for
overall management and oversight of all ongoing
mapping efforts.  This mapping effort was
performed by the US Bureau of Reclamation's (USBR)
Remote Sensing and GIS Group, Technical Service
Center, Denver, CO. The vegetation mapping program
is part of a larger Inventory and Monitoring (I&amp;M)
program started by the National Park Service (NPS)
Their website is : http://www1.nature.nps.gov/im/
</abstract>
<purpose>
The purposes of the mapping effort are varied and
include the following: Provides support for NPS
Resources Management; Promotes vegetation-related
research for both NPS and USGS/BRD; Provides
support for NPS Planning and Compliance; Adds to
the information base for NPS Interpretation; and
Assists in NPS Operations.  The NPS  I&amp;M goals
are, among others, to map the vegetation of all
national parks and monuments and provide a
baseline inventory of vegetation.

<logic>
All polygon features are checked for topology and
existence of label points using the ARC/INFO
software.  Each polygon begins and ends at the
same point with the node feature.  All nodes are
checked for error so that there are no dangling
features except for linear features such as
streams and roads.  There are no duplicate lines
or polygons.  All nodes will snap together and
close polygons based on a specified tolerance.  If
the node is not with the tolerance it is adjusted
manually.  The tests for logical consistency are
performed in ARC/INFO using certain commands.

All data that can be photo-interpreted is
digitized in accordance with the minimum mapping
unit of .5 hectares.  This includes features that
fall into the NVCS vegetation classification and
the Anderson Level II land use classification.
Minimum mapping unit is ostensibly .5 hectares but
some classes below the MMU are included such as
wetlands and grasslands in badlands areas and
polygons cut off by other features and borders.
Roads (out to visible disturbed ground
right-of-way or fence line) and streams/drainages
wider than approx 10 meters were digitized as
polygons and attributed accordingly.  Roads
visible on the DOQQ's but thinner than 10 meters
were digitized as lines.  Wet drainages thinner
than 10 meters were digitized as lines and
attributed with code #14.  Dry drainages thinner
than 10 meters were not digitized.

All vegetation and land use classes were interpreted and mapped from
1:12,000 scale, color infrared photography flown in June 1997. Color
prints were developed from the CIR negatives and have an approximate 20%
overlap east-to-west and 60% north-to-south. Data from the photos was
interpreted on Mylar overlays. Vegetation was delineated and classified
on the mylars using a combination of field and remote sensing
techniques. Field techniques followed the standards described in Field
Methods for Vegetation Mapping (The Nature Conservancy, 1994). These
included preliminary reconnaissance, environmental stratification of the
study area using a gradsect approach (Austin and Heyligers, 1989), and
observation point and detailed plot data collection. Multiple plot and
observation data were collected for each unique vegetation association
found within the study area. Biological, environmental, locational, and
biological interactions/historical/disturbance data were collected at
each sample point using the standard plot survey or observation point
form developed by The Nature Conservancy (1994). Remote sensing
techniques included ground verification of unique photo signatures,
stereoscopic magnification, and photo interpretation of the vegetation
and land-use practices using standard photo interpretation
characteristics such as tone, texture, color, pattern, topographic
position, and shadow. Soil maps were also used to aid in proper
interpretation. Photographs were examined using a stereoscope as needed
and light tables. A detailed photo-interpretation key is provided in the
USBR Technical Memorandum cited elsewhere in this document.

PHOTO INTERPRETATION:  All map classes were
interpreted from 1:12,000 scale,  color infrared
photography flown in June 1997.  The photographs
were produced by Horizons Inc., Rapid City, SD.
Photointerpretation used the standard
identification features such as tone, texture,
color, pattern, topographic position, and shadow.
In addition, field sample locations and their
vegetation descriptions aided in assigning map
class to each polygon. Photographs were examined
using a stereoscope as needed.   GIS PROCEDURES:
Transfer work for the Badlands project will
consist of two methods, either heads-up digitizing
or scanning.  METHOD I:  Heads-up digitizing will
be used whenever the CIR photo does not include
many complicated grassland polygons as these are
the most difficult to transfer using heads-up
digitizing.  This will usually mean photos with
mostly badlands topography or agricultural lands
(i.e., have boundaries that are easy to see on the
digital ortho image) will be transferred using the
heads-up method.  Briefly, heads-up digitizing is
a procedure whereby the operator digitizes by hand
and eye on a computer terminal screen showing a
digital image of an ortho-rectified photo.  By
looking at similar features on both the aerial
photograph from which the classification was made
and on the orthophoto, the line drawn on the
aerial photo overlay is transferred to the digital
image, which is registered to coordinates on the
earth.  This technique should produce good results
except where there is little feature contrast on
the ortho, in which case the operator must
estimate the shape and location of the linework.
Using this technique, a curve on the photo may
appear to be a series of short, differently-angled
straight line segments, since it is easier to make
a curve with a pencil or pen than it is with
digitized discrete points.  Depending on the
density of digitized points, this may or may not
be a problem.  The analyst may set the digitizing
software to calculate a pseudo-curve of many
points by inputting as few as three points to
define a curve.  METHOD II:  Photos that are too
difficult to accurately transfer via heads-up will
be scanned, ie, the mylar overlays will be
scanned, not the actual CIR photo.  Before the
mylar is scanned, it will be marked with control
points that correspond to visible points on the
DOQQ.  Six control points should be located for
best results though a minimum of 4 are required
for a projective transform.  The GIS software was
used to convert the scanned mylar into a
geo-referenced coverage which was then attributed
and combined with the larger vegetation coverage
associated with the quarter quad area.  The entire
transfer and editing sequence was automated via an
in-house ARC/INFO AML.  The final vegetation
coverages consist of (1) Quarter-quad border, (2)
Park boundary arcs, if applicable, and (3)
vegetation polygons and linear features.  Another
step involved heads-up digitizing of roads and
railroads visible on the CIR/DOQQ in accordance
with the criteria discussed under the Completeness
Report above.

VEGETATION COVERAGES: Due to the large size of the
database, vegetation coverages were named
according to associated USGS 7.5m quads. Naming
convention: &lt;quadname&gt;_veg# with # referring to
the quarter quadrant as follows: 1 - Northwest
quadrant; 2 - Northeast quadrant; 3 - Southeast
quadrant; 4 - Southwest quadrant. Coding
Information: Polygon coverage with labels in each
polygon with the following custom items: (veg_code
- 3 3 I) coded with vegetation classification
number.  See Supplemental Info under Id Info above
for complete listing of attribute codes and their
descriptions; (photo - 4 4 I) coded with
associated CIR photo number; (location - 10 10 I)
coded according to whether the polygon is in the
park or environs area; (pdog - 2 2 I) coded with 0
(no pdog holes) or 1 (polygon has pdog holes).
Used to show areas that were not classified as
prairie dog colonies but had substantial pdog use;
Also, each arc was coded as follows: (digtype - 2
2 I)) coded to identify how the arc was
transferred into the database or type of arc as
follows:   1 = heads-up, on screen digitizing; 2 =
scanned mylar; 4 = arc associated with quarterquad
border; 5 = arc associated with park border.
(veg_code - 3 3 I) linear wetland features coded
with vegetation classification number.  Arcs coded
class 14 were extracted and put into a separate
(line) coverage named drainage.  Some of the class
14 arcs remained in the _veg coverage if it also
delineated a unique polygon. BOUNDARY COVERAGES:
bndrypark - Park boundary coverage.  This coverage
was obtained from Badlands National Park
Headquarters. bndryproj - GIS mapping project
area. bndryquad - Boundaries of all the 7.5m
quads. bndrygrds - Grad-sect boundaries. Coding
Information: bndrypark - line coverage - no custom
attributing. bndryproj - line coverage - no custom
attributing. bndryquad - polygon coverage with
labels in each quad polygon with the following
items: (quadname - 8 8 c) - abbreviated name for
each quad; (fullname - 20 20 c) - full quadname.
DATA COVERAGES: dataobsv
- Point coverage of observation data points.
dataplot - Point coverage of plot data points.
Coding Information: Label points with items as
follows: (plot_code - 3 3 n) coded with plot
number from plot data sheets; (veg_code - 14 14 c)
coded with veg class text; (type - 10 10 c) coded
with broad vegetation class (eg: woodland). Note1:
x-coord and y-coord added with ARC/INFO "addxy"
command. Note2:  Field data points were collected
with GPS units set to datum NAD27.  All coverages
were re-projected into Datum NAD83 so the x- y-
coordinates will not match those shown on the data
sheets. OTHER COVERAGES: sec_roads - Line coverage
of secondary roads digitized from USGS DOQQ.
railroads - Line coverage of railroads digitized
from USGS DOQQ. spiritw  - Line coverage of
cultural features observed on the CIR and or DOQQ.
The parks projects will be using DOQQ's as the
basemap for transfer of information from the CIR
photos to the GIS database.  The DOQQ's are
standard USGS product and are in datum of NAD83.
