Congaree Swamp National Monument is located approximately 15 miles southeast
of Columbia, the state capitol of South Carolina.  Old Bluff Highway
(old Highway 48) lies just north of the Monument boundary.  The eastern
boundary is located just northwest of the confluence of the Congaree and
Wateree Rivers.  The Monument extends west to where Cedar Creek and Myers
Creek join.

The criteria differs primarily in that the height
and density variables were not mapped at Congaree
Swamp.  Instead, two additional variables were
addressed:
pre-hurricane Hugo community types and areas of
pine that have been logged since the time of the
1976 aerial photography.

For accuracy assessment, a field visit was made
to 585 points between October, 1999 and May 2000.
Points were located through the use of a PLGR GPS
unit and false-color infrared photographs.  At
each point dominant vegetation types were recorded
and a field key was used to determine the plant
community / cover type present.  Over 85 percent
of the points were reached on foot, the remainder
were located by boat.  When all of the points were
visited, two tables were generated comparing the
field interpretation of the polygons with that of
the photointerpreters.  The final accuracy assessment
was performed through a statistical analysis of the
data using contingency tables and statistical tests.
Most of the problems noted were related to map class
definition and terminology and did not involve map
accuracy per se.  Through the use of contingency
tables and other statistics, the overall accuracy of
the provisional map was calculated as 87 percent.
The statistics from only one class, the "Celtis
laevigata - Liquidambar styraciflua - Quercus
laurifolia / Carpinus caroliniana / Arundinaria
gigantea / Carex lupulina Forest-Sweetgum component"
failed to meet the NPS 80 percent accuracy standards.
Data indicates that this class may be undermapped,
being more widespread than was actually mapped.  See
"Summary Report on the Results of an Accuracy
Assessment of the National Park Service's Provisional
Vegetation Map of Congaree Swamp National Monument"

Following National Park Service Accuracy Assessment guidelines for
Protocols A-D, Dr. Brooks generated a stratified random sample of 596
points through the Monument. Following National Park Service Protocol E,
Dr. Brooks also generated a non-random sample of 32 points which were
termed "unique signatures" by AIS personnel (SEE LITTLESAM for
Protocol E data). Maps of both sets of points, UTM coordinates, and
other pertinent data were given to Dr. L. L. Gaddy, who was in charge of
the field portion of the accuracy assessment. (Dr. Gaddy did not know
which class the photointerpreters had assigned to a given polygon when
he conducted his field work; he could, however, see the polygon
boundaries on the map.)
As USGS-NPS protocol dictated, Gaddy visited 585 points from October,
1999 through May 2000. Points were located through the use of a PLGR
GPS unit and false-color infrared photographs. At each point dominant
vegetation types were recorded and a field key was used to determine the
plant community/cover type present. Over 85 percent of the points were
reached on foot, the remainder were located by boat.
When all of the points had been visited, Dr. Gaddy complete the two
tables comparing his field interpretation of the polygon with that of
the photointerpreters. Dr. Brooks then performed the final accuracy
assessment through a statistical analysis of the data using contingency
tables and statistical tests (see CROSS 1, CROSS 2, AND CROSS 3).
