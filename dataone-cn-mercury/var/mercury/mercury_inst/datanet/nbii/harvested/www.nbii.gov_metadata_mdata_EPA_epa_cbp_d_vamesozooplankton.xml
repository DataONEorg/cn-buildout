<abstract>
The Commonwealth of Virginia, in cooperation with
the US EPA Chesapeake Bay Program, has monitored
plankton species abundance and composition in the
Virginia Chesapeake Bay mainstem and tributaries
since 1985.  The current program is designed to
give comprehensive spatial and temporal
information on plankton. Sampling is performed in
conjunction with the Virginia phytoplankton and
water quality monitoring programs.
</abstract>
<purpose>
The initial objectives of this data set were to
characterize the composition and abundance, and
the spatial and temporal patterns of the
mesozooplankton populations in the lower
Chesapeake Bay and several major tributaries, and
to examine relationships between water quality
conditions and observed zooplankton composition
and abundance.  A major goal is the establishment
of a long term data base that is being used to
identify trends in zooplankton spatio-temporal
patterns of development over time and in relation
to changes in Bay water quality conditions and
other plankton components (Birdsong, 1992; Mateja
et al., 1995).

The zooplankton field chief was the custodian for
all samples collected, verified proper labeling of
bottles, complete field data entries, the
collection of the samples, preservative used and
transport to the laboratory.  They also supervise
the calibration and availability of field
equipment. Samples are turned over to the
laboratory chief who oversees the sample
processing, analysis and recording of the raw
data.  Taxon identifications, raw data sheets and
other stages of the collection and analysis
procedures are routinely checked by the principal
investigator and laboratory chief for quality
assurance.

Sampling of tributary stations did not begin until
January 1986. Sampling in the Elizabeth river did
not begin until January of 1989. Beginning in 1997
a second sampling cruise was added for station in
tidal fresh area (TF3.3, TF4.2, TF5.5) to better
measure food availability in andaromous fish
spawning areas. In 1998 sampling at Elizabeth
River station SBE2 was discontinued. Collection of
Biomass data at all stations was also dicontinued.

From January 1985-February 1998, processing and
analysis of samples is conducted by the
coefficient of variation stabilizing method (Alden
et al. 1982).  Size fractionation of each sample
produces 5 size classes (200, 300,600, 850, 2000
microns).  Size classes in which the organisms are
too numerous to count in their entirety are split
with a folsom plankton splitter until an
appropriate sample size is reached for
statistically valid counts of the dominant
species.  The chosen error level of 35% requires
that each species of interest be counted to
achieve a range of between 20 and 42 individuals
in any given split.  Species observed to be
subdominant in the final split are counted until
they have achieved the range for the 35% error
level.  Taxon abundance is recorded as numbers per
unit volume.

From March 1998 to present, processing and
analysis of samples is  conducted by  a
modification of the coefficient of variation
stabilizing method (Alden et al. 1982).  Size
fractionation of each sample produces 5 size
classes ( 75, 200, 300, 600, 850, 2000 microns).
Size classes in which the organisms are too
numerous to count in their entirety are split with
a folsom plankton splitter until an appropriate
sample size is reached for statistically valid
counts of the dominant species.  The chosen error
level of 35% requires that each species of
interest be counted to achieve a range of between
20 and 42 individuals in any given split.  Species
observed to be subdominant in the final split are
counted until they have achieved the range for the
35% error level.  Taxon abundance is recorded as
numbers per unit volume.

The ash-free dry weights are determined following
the normal biomass drying and weighing procedures.
Following the initial weighing, the dried samples
are directly placed into the muffle furnace for
incineration.  The samples are incinerated in the
furnace at a temperature of 550 degrees C for 4
hours. The samples are allowed to cool to room
temperature and then transferred to a dessicator
for storage until weighing.  Drying, cooling and
weighing are repeated until the succesive weights
vary by less than 5% over a one-day interval.
Exposure from the dessicator never exceeds 5
minutes.

Beroe (BEROE, BEROEVOL),
Hydrozoans(HYDRO,HYDROVOL),  Mnemiopsis(MNEMIOP,
MNEMVOL), and true Jellyfish ((JELLY, JELLYVOL)
were removed from samples and sorted in the field
after sample preservation, their numbers and
settled volumes were recorded from the net that
was used as the count sample.

The following formula is used to calculate
distance traveled by the bongo net during a tow.
DISTANCE=(STOP-START)*BLADE CONSTANT  Where STOP
is the number of revolutions recorded on the bongo
net flow meter at the end of the tow, START is the
number of revolutions on the meter at the
beginning of the tow, DISTANCE is the distance
traveled by the bongo net during the tow. The
blade constant is equal to 26873/999999.  The
sample volume is calculated using the following
equation:  SAMPLE VOLUME= DISTANCE*AREA where AREA
= 0.18776 square meters.
