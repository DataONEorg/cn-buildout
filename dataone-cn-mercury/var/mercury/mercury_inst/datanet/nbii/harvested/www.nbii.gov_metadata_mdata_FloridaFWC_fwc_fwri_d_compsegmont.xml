<abstract>The University of South Florida Coastal Ocean Monitoring and Prediction System (COMPS) Egmont Key coastal monitoring station is located on the NE corner of the USCG dock, a wooden structure on piles that extends 50 meters off the north end of Egmont Key into the mouth of Tampa Bay. The parameters measured at this station are water level, water temperature and conductivity, wind speed and direction, and wind gusts. Data from this station are continuously telemetered by spread spectrum radio to the USF COMPS office and is then made available on the COMPS website. Since March 1, 2003, data from this station has been transmitted to the COMPS office by GOES satellite, which results in a different format. See metadata record "usf_comps_egkn" for a description of Egmont Key data after February 28, 2003. Sensor heights on this station were referenced to NAVD 88 on July 25, 2002 at 2138 UTC.</abstract>
<purpose>The University of South Florida has implemented a real-time Coastal Ocean Monitoring and Prediction System (COMPS) for West Florida. COMPS consists of an array of instrumentation, both along the coast and offshore, combined with numerical circulation models, and builds upon existing in-situ measurements and modeling programs funded by various state and federal agencies. COMPS provides additional data needed for a variety of management issues, including more accurate predictions of coastal flooding by storm surge, safety and efficiency of marine navigation, search and rescue efforts, and fisheries management. COMPS also supports basic research programs.</purpose>
<supplinf>The University of South Florida implemented COMPS in 1997 for West Florida as a State of Florida legislative initiative. The real-time and non real-time meteorological and oceanographic data collected from coastal stations and offshore buoy stations maintained by USF along the West Florida Shelf are part of the COMPS initiative. All USF-COMPS coastal stations are equipped with Aquatrak acoustic water level measurement sensors. The coastal stations also have a variety of meteorological and oceanographic sensors: RM Young anemometers for wind speed and direction, barometric pressure sensors, air temperature and realtive humidity sensors, rain gages, water temperature and conductivity sensors, fluorometers and transmissometers. Note that not all the stations have all these sensors. They are installed on each stations based on the need. COMPS buoy-mounted meteorological sensors consist of either the Coastal Environmental Systems Weatherpak 2000 system, modified to accommodate GOES telemetry, or the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) Improved METeorology (IMET) system, which has now evolved into the Air Sea Interaction METeorology (ASIMET) system, which is presently being manufactured by Star Engineering. The Weatherpaks measure wind speed and direction, air and water temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure. IMET and ASIMET measures the above parameters plus incoming short and long wave radiation and precipitation.  (previous geoform was 'tabular digital data')</supplinf>

<datacred>The COMPS program is supported by the State of Florida and the University of South Florida, College of Marine Science. The Egmont Key station is funded in part by the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Weather Service, and the Office of Naval Research. It is maintained by the USF College of Marine Science. Dr. Mark Luther and Dr. Bob Weisberg are the Co-directors of the COMPS Program. The COMPS field program directors, COMPS data manager, and COMPS system administrator have also contributed to the dataset.</datacred>
<native>The raw and de-coded data from this station is stored in SGI/Linux and PC/Windows based computers and are presently served on the internet.</native>

The near real-time data from the Egmont Key Coastal Station data can be accessed via the website http://comps1.marine.usf.edu/egkn/. This site was upgraded in 2005 to new Campbell Scientific Data logger and suited with two types of data telemetry: Line-of-site radio communication and GOES data telemetry. In 2004, the site had line-of-site radio communication.
Measurements are made every 6 minutes at the site and acquired via line-of-site radio and with the GOES data telemetry measurements made every six minutes are transmitted once an hour, giving 10 samples in an hour. The default web site http://comps1.marine.usf.edu/egkn/ that displays the line-of-site radio data and the access to the GOES data telemetry data via a hyperlink from the default web site. The line-of-site data display is update every six minutes and GOES data telemetry data gets updated once an hour. Data for the past 24-hour in report form can be accessed via the website. Various Data Display (Time series plots Past 24 hours and 5- Days) are also available for download from the website. The details of data format are also provided in the website. The decoded data files of the USF COMPS Egmont Key site can be accessed by pointing the browser to the URL:ftp://comps.marine.usf.edu/pub/egkn.
The data format details are also available. For further details on data availability and access, please contact COMPS Program Data Manager. The station log of maintenance, problems, and observations relevant to the Sensor systems on the stations are maintained in College of Marine Science, University of South Florida, St. Petersburg, Florida. The raw data telemetred from the station are archived at College of Marine Science, University of South Florida. The raw data will be provided based on request to the Pricipal Investigators of the USF COMPS Project.

A brief overview of the data processing steps of USFCMS COMPS Coastal and Offshore weather monitoring data is presented here. Detailed description of the processing scripts used are available at College of Marine Science, University of South Florida.
USF has two downlink systems to acquire the coastal and offshore stations data via GOES: a Digital Direct Reading Ground Station (DDRGS) and a Domestic Satellite rebroadcast receiving system (DOMSAT). We also download our data from NESDIS using Local Readout Ground Station software package obtained from NOAA, NESDIS. The hourly data streams (meteorological and water parameters) received from coastal stations consist of ten 6-minute samples. The hourly data streams (measurements of meteorological parameters) that are received from the offshore stations consist of four 15-minute and three 20-minute samples for buoys equipped with Coastal Climate WeatherPak systems and USF/ASIMET systems respectively. The ADCP (velocities, direction) consist of one sample per hour. The salinity and temperature data consist of three 20 minute samples on IMET/ASIMET type buoys and two 30 minute samples on coastal climate weatherpak buoys. Once received the data are processed using decoder scripts written in C and Perl programming languages.  Observations are then served to the public via the Internet at http://comps.marine.usf.edu.  These data are also available via the NDBC who have direct access for input to the National Center for Environmental Prediction for improved marine weather forecasts at http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/Maps/Florida.shtml.  The most recent observations, graphics and reports (past one and five days duration) generated from the data are available for download from the individual station web site. Development of a web based data management system is in progress.

<overview>
<eaover>The individual environmental observations made at this station are described in the Detailed Description of this metadata record. The primary water level values in the data record represent the distance from the sensor to the water surface, so a receding water level will appear as an increase in the value. To obtain the correct water level, use the computation provided in the station's format (.fmt) file with the reference datum. Missing measurements are denoted by -99.9.</eaover>
