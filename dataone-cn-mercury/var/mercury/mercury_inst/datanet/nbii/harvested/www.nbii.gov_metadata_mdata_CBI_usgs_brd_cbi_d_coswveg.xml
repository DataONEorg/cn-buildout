<abstract>
The National Park Service (NPS), in conjunction
with the Biological Resources Division (BRD) of
the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has implemented
a program to "develop a uniform hierarchical
vegetation methodology" at a national level.  The
program will also create a geographic information
system (GIS) database for the parks under its
management.  The purpose of the data is to
document the state of vegetation within the NPS
service area during the 1990's, thereby providing
a baseline study for further analysis at the
Regional or Service-wide level.  The vegetation
units of this map were determined through
stereoscopic interpretation of aerial photographs
supported by field sampling and ecological
analysis.  The vegetation boundaries were
identified on the photographs by means of the
photographic signatures and collateral information
on slope, hydrology, geography, and vegetation in
accordance with the Standardized National
Vegetation Classification System (October 1995).
The mapped vegetation reflects conditions that
existed during the specific year and season that
the aerial photographs were taken (April, 1996).
There is an inherent margin of error in the use of
aerial photography for vegetation delineation and
classification.
</abstract>
<purpose>
The purpose of this spatial data is to provide the
National Park Service the necessary tools to
manage the natural resources within this park
system.  Several parks, representing different
regions, environmental conditions, and vegetation
types, were chosen by BRD to be part of the
prototype phase of the program.  The initial goal
of the prototype phase is to "develop, test,
refine, and finalize the standards and protocols"
to be used during the production phase of the
project.  This includes the development of a
standardized vegetation classification system for
each park and the establishment of
photointerpretation, field, and accuracy
assessment procedures.  Congaree Swamp National
Monument was designated as one of the prototype
parks.  Congaree Swamp National Monument,
established in 1976, was designated as one of the
prototypes within the National Park System.  The
park contains approximately 22,200 acres (34
square miles). Congaree Swamp National Monument is
located approximately 15 miles southeast of
Columbia, the state capitol of South Carolina.
The Congaree River, draining over 8,000 square
miles of Piedmont land to the northwest, forms the
southern border.
</purpose>
<supplinf>
On June 30, 1983, Congaree Swamp National Monument
became an International Biosphere Reserve.
Congaree is noted for containing one of the last
significant stands of old growth bottomland
hardwood forest, over 11,000 acres in all.  The
Monument contains over 90 species of trees, 16 of
which hold state records for size.  Included in
this list of records is a national record sweet
gum with a basal circumference of nearly 20 feet.

Congaree Swamp National Monument is located
approximately 15 miles southeast of Columbia, the
state capitol of South Carolina.  Old Bluff
Highway (old Highway 48) lies just north of the
Monument boundary.  The eastern boundary is
located just northwest of the confluence of the
Congaree and Wateree Rivers.  The Monument extends
west to where Cedar Creek and Myers Creek join.

Code verification involved running each
coverage attribute file through a series of ARC/INFO
commands that checked for invalid codes.  These
commands produced listings that aided in
identifying abnormal codes.  The errors were
checked against the vegetation delineation
and attribute overlays.  Corrections were made to the
listings and input into the database.   ESRI
produced a plot of the converted spatial data and
sequence numbers (label I.D.s) for the manuscript.
The plot was checked by AIS for cartographic
quality of the arcs defining the polygon features
and the accuracy of the label I.D. assignments.
The plot was overlaid to the manuscript map to
verify that the scanned data was not distorted
beyond .02 map inches.  Other problems were noted
on the plots, such as overshoots and undershoots,
missing lines, premature convergence of polygon
boundary lines that intersected arcs at acute
angles, and incorrect sequence number assignments.
ESRI produced code verification plots of the
community association codes, height and density
codes, and land use code attributes.  The plots
were checked for coding errors that may have
occurred during the polygon attribute encoding
step.  The plots were overlaid on the manuscript
map with attached corresponding code attribute
overlay created in the manual rectification step.
Code changes were noted on the plot.  The edited
plots were delivered back to ESRI for correction
of the attribute files.   Processors conducted
interactive ARCEDIT sessions to make the necessary
corrections to the coverages.
For accuracy assessment, a field visit was made
to 585 points between October, 1999 and May 2000.
Points were located through the use of a PLGR GPS
unit and false-color infrared photographs.  At
each point dominant vegetation types were recorded
and a field key was used to determine the plant
community / cover type present.  Over 85 percent
of the points were reached on foot, the remainder
were located by boat.  When all of the points were
visited, two tables were generated comparing the
field interpretation of the polygons with that of
the photointerpreters.  The final accuracy assessment
was performed through a statistical analysis of the
data using contingency tables and statistical tests.
Most of the problems noted were related to map class
definition and terminology and did not involve map
accuracy per se.  Through the use of contingency
tables and other statistics, the overall accuracy of
the provisional map was calculated as 87 percent.
The statistics from only one class, the "Celtis
laevigata - Liquidambar styraciflua - Quercus
laurifolia / Carpinus caroliniana / Arundinaria
gigantea / Carex lupulina Forest-Sweetgum component"
failed to meet the NPS 80 percent accuracy standards.
Data indicates that this class may be undermapped,
being more widespread than was actually mapped.  See

Assessment of the National Park Service's Provisional
Vegetation Map of Congaree Swamp National Monument"

All polygon features are checked for topology
using the ARC/INFO software.  Each polygon begins
and ends at the same point with the node feature.
All nodes are checked for error so that there are
no dangling features.  There are no duplicate
lines or polygons.  All nodes will snap together
and close polygons based on a specific tolerance.
If the node is not within the tolerance, it is
adjusted manually.  The test for logical
consistency are performed in ARC/INFO.

Development of Photointerpretation Mapping
Procedures  The normal process in vegetation
mapping is to conduct an initial field
reconnaissance, map the vegetation units through
photointerpretation, and then conduct a field
verification.  The field reconnaissance visit
serves two major functions.   First, the
photointerpreter keys the signature on the aerial
photos to the vegetation on the ground at each
signature site.  Second, the photointerpreter
becomes familiar with the flora, vegetation
communities and local ecology that occur in the
study area.  Park and/or TNC field biologists that
are familiar with the local vegetation and ecology
of the park are present to help the
photointerpreter understand these elements and
their relationship with the geography of the park.
Upon completion of the field reconnaissance,
photo interpreters delineate vegetation units on
mylar that overlay the 9x9 aerial photos.  This
effort is conducted in accordance with the TNC
vegetation classification and criteria for
defining each community or alliance.  The initial
mapping is then followed by a field verification
session, whose purpose is to verify that the
vegetation units were mapped correctly.  Any PI
related questions are also addressed during the
visit.  The vegetation mapping at Congaree Swamp
National Monument in general followed the normal
mapping procedure as described in the above
paragraph with two major exceptions:  1)
Preliminary delineations for most of the park,
including a set of Focused Transect overlays that
were labeled with an initial PI signature
commenced prior to the field reconnaissance visit.
2) A TNC classification did not exist at the time
the initial delineations began.  TNC ecologist and
AIS photo interpreters worked together to develop
an interim signature key which addressed what was
known at the time.  At that time, no comprehensive
study containing plot data was available to create
an interim classification.  Development of
Photointerpretation Mapping Criteria  From the
onset of the Vegetation Inventory and Mapping
Program, a standardized  program-wide mapping
criteria has been used.  The mapping criteria
contains a set of documented working decision
rules used to facilitate the maintenance of
accuracy and consistency of the
photointerpretation.  This criteria assists the
user in understanding the characteristics,
definition and context for each vegetation
community.  The mapping criteria for Congaree
Swamp National Monument was composed of four
parts:  &amp;middot; The standardized program-wide general
mapping criteria &amp;middot; A park specific mapping
criteria &amp;middot; A working photo signature key &amp;middot; The TNC
classification, key and descriptions  The
following sections detail the mapping criteria
used during the photointerpretation of Congaree
Swamp.   General Mapping Criteria  The mapping
criteria at Congaree Swamp are a modified version
from previously mapped parks.  The criteria
differs primarily in that the height and density
variables were not mapped at Congaree Swamp.
Instead, two additional variables were addressed:
pre-hurricane Hugo community types and areas of
pine that have been logged since the time of the
1976 aerial photography.  These two categories
will be addressed in the Park Specific Mapping
Criteria section of this report.  Since forest
densities within the Monument are nearly always
greater than 60%, it served little or no purpose
in addressing this element as a separate attribute
in the database.  In addition it was also
determined that height categories are extremely
difficult to map in the Monument due to
variability of the tree emergent layer, and lack
of any significant reference points that help in
determining canopy heights.  Alliance / Community
Associations  The assignment of alliance and
community association to the vegetation is based
on criteria formulated by the field effort and
classification development.  In the case of
Congaree Swamp National Monument, TNC provided AIS
with a tentative community classification in April
1998.  A final vegetation classification, key, and
descriptions of each alliance and community, was
provided in October 1998.  In addition, TNC
provided AIS with detailed plot data showing how
the communities were developed in the Monument.

<overview>
<eaover>
The system is organized hierarchically to support
conservation and resource stewardship applications
across multiple scales.  The upper levels of the
hierarchy are based on the physical form or
structure of the vegetation (physiognomy) and have
been refined from the international standards
developed by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
The two most detailed levels of the hierarchy are
based on the species composition of the existing
vegetation (floristics) and reflect the
phyto-sociological standards that were originally
developed by European ecologists.  The vegetation
classification is continually advanced through the
collection and analysis of new field data and will
be greatly strengthened during the course of the
USGS-NPS mapping efforts.  USGS-NPS VEGETATION
