<abstract>Windblown silt and clay, also known as aeolian dust, are important components of arid ecosystems because they may contribute to soil formation and furnish essential soil nutrients. The USGS, working with researchers at the University of Colorado, has developed a combination of methods to identify the presence of this dust in arid regions and to evaluate their roles in desert ecosystems. The researchers used these methods to characterize the dust in the Canyonlands regions of Utah. Analysis of the size and type of soil particles suggests that wind-blown dust is typically as much as 20-30 percent of the fine soil particles. Dust additions enrich the sediments in many elements, such as phosphorus, magnesium, and sodium. Thus dust additions or losses can alter soil fertility significantly and affect many properties of arid lands, including the types and productivity of plants. Land uses have the potential to alter historic patterns of dust addition and erosion.</abstract>
