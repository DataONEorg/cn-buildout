<abstract>
An evaluation of adaptive cluster sampling was
based on a simulation experiment where samples
were drawn from an enumeration of three species of
waterfowl wintering in central Florida.  The
initial samples were taken either by simple random
sampling or with probability proportional to
available habitat. Efficiency of adaptive cluster
sampling relative to simple random sampling was
highest when 1) the within-network variance was
close to the population variance, and 2) the final
sampling fraction was close to the initial
sampling fraction.  The within-network variance is
determined by the spatial distribution of the
population, quadrat size, and the condition that
determined when to adapt sampling.  The final
sampling fraction depends on the previous factors
as well as the size and selection of the initial
sample. Some combinations of these factors led to
increased precision compared to simple random
sampling and some did not.

<purpose>
Objective was to evaluate adaptive sampling for
three species of waterfowl.  The evaluation was
based on a simulation experiment for which the
samples were drawn from an enumeration of
ring-necked ducks (Aythya collaris), blue-winged
teal (Anas discors), and green-winged teal (Anas
crecca) in 5,000 km2 of central Florida.  The
population density of ring-necked ducks was of
primary concern because of the species' importance
to waterfowl harvest in Florida.

The surveys were flown under clear skies and the
ducks occupied open habitats resulting in good
conditions for counting.  Nevertheless,
detectability was probably not perfect causing
some ducks to be missed or counted more than once.
In aerial surveys of wildlife that result in
imperfect counts, the density estimate is often
used as a population index.

An effort was made to count every individual duck
of the three waterfowl species in a 5,000 km2 area
of central Florida by making systematic flights
over the entire study region.  Two biologists
counted waterfowl from separate helicopters (Bell
Jet Rangers) during 13-15 December, 1992 and used
the LORAN-C and GPS systems to determine flock
locations.
</methdesc>

<procstep>
<procdesc>
Used MonteCarlo simulation to draw samples from
the enumerated populations.  Uniform random
devices were generated by an algorithm presented
in Press et al. (1992, pp. 272-273) and used to
draw random number samples.  Density was estimated
using several designs. Values of the density
estimators and the number of distinct units in the
sample were averaged over 1,000 replicate samples.
The averages were interpreted as expected values
where r denotes the number of replications.
Precision of estimates was compared across
designs.
