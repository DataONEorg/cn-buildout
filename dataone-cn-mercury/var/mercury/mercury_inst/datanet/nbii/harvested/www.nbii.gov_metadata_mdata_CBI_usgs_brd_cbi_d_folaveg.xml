<abstract>
The National Park Service (NPS), in conjunction with the Biological
Resources Division (BRD) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has
implemented a program to "develop a uniform hierarchical vegetation
methodology" at a national level. The program will also create
a geographic information system (GIS) database for the parks under its
management. The purpose of the data is to document the state of
vegetation within the NPS service area during the 1990's, thereby
providing a baseline study for further analysis at the Regional or
Service-wide level. The vegetation units of this map were determined
through stereoscopic interpretation of aerial photographs supported by
field sampling and ecological analysis. The vegetation boundaries were
identified on the photographs by means of the photographic signatures
and collateral information on slope, hydrology, geography, and
vegetation in accordance with the Standardized National Vegetation
Classification System (October 1995). The mapped vegetation reflects
conditions that existed during the specific year and season that the
aerial photographs were taken (July, 1995). There is an inherent margin
of error in the use of aerial photography for vegetation delineation and
classification.
</abstract>
<purpose>
The purpose of this spatial data is to provide the National Park Service
the necessary tools to manage the natural resources within this park
system. Several parks, representing different regions, environmental
conditions, and vegetation types, were chosen by BRD to be part of the
prototype phase of the program. The initial goal of the prototype phase
is to "develop, test, refine, and finalize the standards and protocols"
to be used during the production phase of the project. This includes the
development of a standardized vegetation classification system for each
park and the establishment of photointerpretation, field, and accuracy
assessment procedures. Fort Laramie National Historic Site was
designated as one of the prototype parks. The monument is located in the
high Great Plains. It contains prairie, hill, and riverine environments,
with vegetation types that include upland woodland, prairie grassland,
riverine woodland, and wetlands.
</purpose>
<supplinf>
Fort Laramie National Historic Site was created by the National Park
Service on July 16, 1938. The park occupies 833 acres of land on the
Laramie River, west of its confluence with the North Platte River in
western Wyoming. Bureau of Land Management land south of the park
(referred to as Plot 3) and northwest of the park (referred to as Plots
1 and 5) are also within the mapping study area. The park is primarily
preserved as an historic site. The fort site was occupied first as a fur
trading center, then subsequently as a military outpost. It further
served as a way station for trappers, traders, and emigrants on the
Oregon Trail. The old fort site, located in the western end of the park,
contains a complex of restored buildings and ruins, dating from mid and
late 19th century, surrounding a lawn quadrangle. The remainder of the
park contains disturbed prairie and floodplains. The park itself lies
mainly on the floodplain terrace of the Laramie River, with a portion on
the North Platte River floodplain terrace just west of their confluence.
A small portion of the northwest corner of the park lies above the
terrace. Plot 3 lies directly south of the park, across the Fort Laramie
Canal. It is an area of rolling hills. Plots 1 and 5 lie 1/4 mile
northwest of the park, also in rolling hills. The park is surrounded by
rolling hills that are used for grazing and some agricultural
cultivation. The city of Fort Laramie is located 3 miles to the
northeast of the park.

Developmental of Programmatic and Technical Team:
This project required the combined expertise and oversight of several
organizations. Oversight and programmatic considerations are managed
by the Center for Biological Informatics of the Biological Resources
Division of the U.S. Geological Survey. The National Park Service
provided additional guidance. The technical responsibilities for the
mapping effort were divided between TNC and AIS. TNC responsibilities
and deliverables included the following: Create a vegetation
classification system based upon field species level data and
consistent with the Standard National Classification System at the
Alliance or Community Element level Provide documentation that
describes the national classes at the local and global levels, with
field keys, and field data in a *.dbf format. Provide technical
opinion to BOR as the mapping portion of the project proceeds. Provide
field notes and site descriptions BOR responsibilities and
deliverables included the following: Digital files of vegetation on
Compact (CD); including topology and labeling for height, density, and
pattern subclasses; location of field sample sites; and locations of
sites used for accuracy assessment in Arc/Info format Any ancillary
digital files developed during the mapping process Digital FGDC
compliant metadata file for each digital file delivered Annotated
field site photographs Original mylar overlays of interpreted
photographs Hard copy vegetation map Accuracy assessment Final report
describing all procedures used in developing the final map and
accuracy assessment Planning and Review Meeting An initial meeting was
held with all interested parties to discuss several aspects of the
mapping effort. Foremost among these was the mapping extent.
Vegetation issues particular to the park were addressed. Preliminary
Data Collection and Review of Existing Information To reduce duplicating
previous work and to help in our effort we collected existing vegetation
reports and maps from the staff at Fort Laramie National Historic Site.
These materials were referenced during the mapping process and the
information contained in them was incorporated where it was deemed useful.
Because soils also affect the distribution of vegetation, soil maps and
soil descriptions were also obtained as reference. These were not converted
to a digital file. Digital elevation models (DEM) were obtained to
create slope and aspect maps that helped in determining vegetation
community distribution. Vegetation Sampling The sampling approach used
in this mapping effort was typical of small park sampling, where all
polygons within the park boundary are sampled. Two levels of field
data gathering were conducted in this park; plots and observations.
Plots represented the most intensive sampling of the landscape and
used TNC's 'Plot Form'. Observations consisted of brief descriptions
and were designed to obtain a quick overview of the landscape without
spending a large amount of time at each sample site. Observation
points used the 'Observation Form' data sheet. Examples of both 'Plot'
and 'Observation' forms are included in the companion report by TNC.
Initially, plots were used to describe the vegetation of the park. A
total of 49 plots were obtained from July through August 1996.
These plots were used by TNC to describe the vegetation associations
found within the park. These descriptions are in the companion report
by TNC. Map Validation A field trip was conducted in July of 1997 to
assess the initial mapping effort and to refine map class.

Photo interpretation was done by trained interpreters familiar with the
vegetation communities of the Site on overlays registered to the aerial
photographs under a stereoscope.  Vegetation communities were identified
on the basis of their color, pattern, texture, and location on the landscape
and lines were drawn around the communities.  The photo interpreters had
visited the monument and conferred with the ecologists who performed the
vegetation classification and were familiar with the vegetation communities.
Not all vegetation associations could be identified on the photography due to
size constraints and complexity of the vegetation.  Map classes were assigned
in these cases and a cross-walk was made to the vegetation classification
</srccontr>
</srcinfo>
<procstep>
<procdesc>
Air Photo Interpretation All map classes were interpreted from existing
1:12,000 scale, color photography taken on July 25, 1995. The photographs
were acquired from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). Photointerpretation
used the standard identification features such as tone, texture, color,
pattern, topographic position, and shadow. In addition, field sample
locations and their vegetation descriptions aided in assigning map class
to each polygon. All photographs were examined using a stereoscope.
Digital elevation models (DEM's) were processed and converted to slope and
aspect coverages. These helped to provide additional perspectives of the
landscape. Seven photographs were interpreted for the entire mapping area.
Digital scans of these photographs are included as .tif files on the CD
included with this report.

In conjunction with the photo verification and field sampling effort, NBS
(now USGS, BRD, CBI) personnel performed a locational accuracy test
comparing the accuracy of a global positioning system (GPS) versus
manual location techniques. The TNC biologist "pin-pricked" all of the
sample site locations onto the aerial photos while the NBS staff
captured the location using GPS. The "pin-pricked" locations were
subsequently input into the GIS database for comparison against the GPS
locations for the same site.

The system is organized hierarchically to support conservation and
resource stewardship applications across multiple scales. The upper levels
of the hierarchy are based on the physical form or structure of the
vegetation (physiognomy) and have been refined from the international
standards developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The two most detailed levels of the
hierarchy are based on the species composition of the existing vegetation
(floristics) and reflect the phyto-sociological standards that were
originally developed by European ecologists. The vegetation classification
is continually advanced through the collection and analysis of new field
data and will be greatly strengthened during the course of the NBS/NPS
mapping efforts. National Park Service/Biological Resources Division

Historic Site Alliance/Community Association Photo Signature Key - Table
Descriptions The Final Alliance/Community Association Photo Signature Key
is divided into six categories. The column descriptions are as follows:
Column 1 - ALLIANCE/COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION CODE This column contains the
code in the database representing the alliance/community association
category. Column 2 - ALLIANCE/COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION This column contains
the title of the alliance/community association category. Alliance name is
listed above the community association name. Column 3 - PHOTO SIGNATURE
This column describes the photo signatures that characterize the life form
of the alliance/community association in this park. The following
subcategories are included: Color: Describes the color tone and contrast
variations of the photo signature. Texture: Describes the relative
apparent roughness or smoothness of the signature character. Coarse being
a very rough or grainy texture, fine being a very smooth texture. A forest
of trees tends to have a coarse texture. Grasslands tend to have a fine
texture. Crown Size: Describes the relative size of the tree or shrub
crown diameter as viewed on the aerial photo. Typically, spreading trees
tend to have large crowns while shrubs tend to have smaller crowns. Crown
Shape: Describes the relative shape of the tree or shrub crown as viewed
on the aerial photo. Density: Describes the general density characteristic
of the alliance/community association. Column 4 - HEIGHT This column
describes the relative height range of the life form of the
alliance/community association. Column 5 - CONTEXT This column describes
the general occurrence of the alliance/community association within the
park from a geomorphological, physiographic, topographical, or regional
perspective. Column 6 - NOTES This column includes other pertinent
information that may be useful in the photointerpretation of the
alliance/community association. It may contain examples of occurrences or
character of the vegetation within the park. Final Alliance/Community
