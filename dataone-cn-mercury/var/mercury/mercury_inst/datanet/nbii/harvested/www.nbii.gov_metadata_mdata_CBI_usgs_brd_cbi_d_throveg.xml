<abstract>
This metadata is for all coverages associated with
the vegetation land cover and land use geo-spatial
database for Theodore Roosevelt National Park and
surrounding areas.  The project is authorized as
part of the USGS/NPS Vegetation Mapping Program.
The program is being administered by the
Biological Resources Division (BRD) of the United
States Geological Survey (USGS).  The USGS/BRD is
responsible for overall management and oversight
of all ongoing mapping efforts.  This mapping
effort was performed by the US Bureau of
Reclamation's (USBR) Remote Sensing and GIS Group,
Technical Service Center, Denver, CO. The
vegetation mapping program is part of a larger
Inventory and Monitoring (I&amp;M) program started by
the National Park Service (NPS) Their website is :
http://www.aqd.nps.gov/nrid/im/
</abstract>
<purpose>
The purposes of the mapping effort are varied and
include the following: Provides support for NPS
Resources Management; Promotes vegetation-related
research for both NPS and USGS/BRD; Provides
support for NPS Planning and Compliance; Adds to
the information base for NPS Interpretation; and
Assists in NPS Operations.  The NPS  I&amp;M goals
are, among others, to map the vegetation of all
national parks and monuments and provide a
baseline inventory of vegetation.

<logic>
All polygon features are checked for topology and
existence of label points using the ARC/INFO
software.  Each polygon begins and ends at the
same point with the node feature.  All nodes are
checked for error so that there are no
unintentional dangling features.  There are no
duplicate lines or polygons.  All nodes will snap
together and close polygons based on a specified
tolerance.  If the node is not with the tolerance
it is adjusted manually.  The tests for logical
consistency are performed in ARC/INFO using
certain commands.
</logic>
<complete>
All data that can be photo-interpreted are
digitized in accordance with the minimum mapping
unit (MMU) of 1/2 hectare.  This includes selected
features that fall into the NVCS vegetation
classification and the Anderson Level II land use
classification.  Some classes below the MMU are
included such as wetlands and grasslands in
badlands areas and polygons cut off by other
features and borders.  Roads (out to visible
disturbed ground right-of-way or fence line) and
streams/drainages wider than approx 10 meters were
digitized as polygons and attributed accordingly.
Roads visible on the orthophotos but thinner than
10 meters were digitized as lines. Wet drainages
thinner than 10 meters were digitized as lines and
attributed with code #14.  Dry drainages thinner
than 10 meters were not digitized.

PHOTO INTERPRETATION:  All map classes were
interpreted from 1:24,000 scale,  color
photography flown in July &amp; August 1996.  The
photographs were acquired from the USDA and were
enlarged to 1:12000. Photo-interpretation used the
standard identification features such as tone,
texture, color, pattern, topographic position, and
shadow.  In addition, field sample locations and
their vegetation descriptions aided in assigning
map class to each polygon. Photographs were
examined using a stereoscope as needed.  Linework
was created on mylars placed over the photos.  GIS
PROCEDURES:  The linework on the mylar overlays
were transferred into the GIS database by one of
two methods, either heads-up digitizing or
scanning.  METHOD I:  Heads-up digitizing will be
used whenever the photo does not include many
complicated grassland polygons as these are the
most difficult to transfer using heads-up
digitizing.  This will usually mean photos with
mostly badlands topography or agricultural lands
(i.e., have boundaries that are easy to see on the
digital orthophoto image) will be transferred
using the heads-up method.  Briefly, heads-up
digitizing is a procedure whereby the operator
digitizes by hand and eye on a computer terminal
screen showing a digital image of an
ortho-rectified photo.  By looking at similar
features on both the aerial photograph from which
the classification was made and on the orthophoto,
the line drawn on the aerial photo overlay is
transferred to the digital image, which is
registered to coordinates on the earth.  This
technique should produce good results except where
there is little feature contrast on the ortho, in
which case the operator must estimate the shape
and location of the line work.  Using this
technique, a curve on the photo may appear to be a
series of short, differently-angled straight line
segments, since it is easier to make a curve with
a pencil or pen than it is with digitized discrete
points.  Depending on the density of digitized
points, this may or may not be a problem.  The
analyst may set the digitizing software to
calculate a pseudo-curve of many points by
inputting as few as three points to define a
curve.  METHOD II:  Photos that are too difficult
to accurately transfer via heads-up will be
scanned, ie, the mylars overlays will be scanned,
not the actual photos.  Before the mylar is
scanned, it will be marked with control points
that correspond to visible points on the DOQQ.
The GIS software was used to convert the scanned
mylar into a geo-referenced coverage which was
then attributed and combined with the larger
vegetation coverage associated with the quarter
quad area.  The entire transfer and editing
sequence was automated via in-house Arc/INFO AML
programs.  The final vegetation coverages consist
of (1) Quarter-quad, Park, and GIS project area
boundary arcs, if applicable, and (2) vegetation
polygons. Linear wetland features were put in a
separate coverage called 'drainage'.  Another step
involved heads-up digitizing of roads and
railroads visible on the DOQQ in accordance with
the criteria discussed  above. OTHER DATA:
Coverages for the plot and observation data points
were created from the plot and observation data
sheets.  The coordinates on the data sheets were
in datum NAD27.  Once the coverages were finalized
they were reprojected into datum NAD83. The
Drainage coverage was created by taking arcs
attributed with veg_code = 14 out of the
vegetation coverage and 'put' into the drainage
coverage.

VEGETATION COVERAGES: Due to the large size of the
database, vegetation coverages were named
according to associated USGS 7.5m quads.
Exception; the Elkhorn Ranch Unit coverage is
named ranch_veg. Naming convention:
&lt;quadname&gt;_veg# with # referring to the quarter
quadrant as follows: 1 - Northwest quadrant; 2 -
Northeast quadrant; 3 - Southeast quadrant; 4 -
Southwest quadrant. Coding Information: Polygon
coverage with labels in each polygon with the
following custom items: (veg_code - 3 3 I)* coded
with vegetation classification number.  See
Supplemental Info under Id Info above for complete
listing of attribute codes and their descriptions;
(photo - 6 6 I) coded with associated photo
number; (location - 10 10 I) coded according to
whether the polygon is in the park or environs
(buffer) area; (pdog - 2 2 I) for prairie dog
colonies coded with 0 (no pdog holes) or 1
(polygon has pdog holes); and (lspr - 2 2 I) for
leafy spurge coded with 0 for none and 1 for
polygon has leafy spurge.  These last two items
were used to show areas that were not classified
as prairie dog colonies or leafy spurge but had
substantial pdog use or leafy spurge; Also, each
arc was coded as follows: (digtype - 2 2 I)) coded
to identify how the arc was transferred into the
database or type of arc as follows:   1 =
heads-up, on screen digitizing; 2 = scanned mylar;
3 = arc associated with GIS project border; 4 =
arc associated with quarterquad border; 5 = arc
associated with park border. (veg_code - 3 3 I)
linear wetland features coded with vegetation
classification number.  Arcs attributed class 14
were extracted and put into a separate (line)
coverage named drainage.  Some of the class 14
arcs remained in the _veg coverage if it also
delineated a unique polygon. BOUNDARY COVERAGES:
bndrypark - Park boundary coverage.  This coverage
was obtained from Theodore Roosevelt National Park
Headquarters. bndryproj - GIS mapping project
area. bndryquad - Boundaries of all the 7.5m
quads. bndrygrds - Grad-sect boundaries. Coding
Information: bndrypark - line coverage - no custom
attributing. bndryproj - line coverage - no custom
attributing. bndryquad - polygon coverage with
labels in each quad polygon with the following
items: (quadname - 8 8 c) - abbreviated name for
each quad; (fullname - 20 20 c) - full quadname.
DATA COVERAGES: dataobsv
- Point coverage of observation data points.
dataplot - Point coverage of plot data points.
Coding Information: Label points with items as
follows: (plot_code - 3 3 n) coded with plot
number from plot data sheets; (veg_code - 14 14 c)
coded with veg class text; (type - 10 10 c) coded
with broad vegetation class (eg: woodland). Note1:
x-coord and y-coord added with ARC/INFO "addxy"
command. Note2:  Field data points were collected
with GPS units set to datum NAD27.  All coverages
were re-projected into Datum NAD83 so the x- y-
coordinates will not match those shown on the data
sheets. OTHER COVERAGES: sec_roads - Line coverage
of secondary roads digitized from USGS DOQQ.
railroads - Line coverage of railroads digitized
from USGS DOQQ. The parks projects will be using
DOQQ's as the basemap for transfer of information
from the photos to the GIS database.  The DOQQ's
are standard USGS product and are in datum of
NAD83. (*) Item definition in the arc/info
