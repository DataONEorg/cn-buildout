<abstract>This GIS data set represents aquatic preserves (AP) in the State of Florida. The Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) originally created Aquatic Preserves (AP) in the State of Florida from legal descriptions using 1:24000 scale shoreline. Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Coastal and Aquatic Managed Areas (CAMA) now maintains the data set. Aquatic preserves are ecologically significant submerged lands maintained in relatively pristine condition.</abstract>
<purpose>Divisions within the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) have felt the need to develop digital coverages for the state-owned or managed properties they oversee and are in the process of reducing the legal descriptions on deeds into a digital form by interpreting and transferring the legal description to a quad sheet or using one or another of the COordinate GeOmetry (COGO) systems. These lands include the Aquatic Preserves and the State Park boundaries. Where possible, to minimize duplication of effort, the Department acquired the boundaries already created for the Aquatic Preserves.</purpose>
<supplinf>
Prior to July 1, 2004, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) was known as the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI). The institute name has not been changed in historical data sets or references to work completed by the Florida Marine Research Institute. The institute name has been changed in references to ongoing research, new research, and contact information.
Aquatic Preserve (AP) information is available in two different versions. This version contains AP information maintained by Coastal and Aquatic Managed Areas (CAMA). AP information is also available in the Outstanding Florida Waters layer. Currently, all APs are also Outstanding Florida Waters (OFWs). This was not the case in the past and may change again in the future, but an AP was dropped. It's important to note that there are three APs whose OFW boundaries differ from the AP boundary. These are described more specifically in the OFW rule 62-302.700.  The Indian River Malabar to Vero expansion does not include portions of Sebastion and Turkey Creeks.  The Wekiva River does not include portions of the St.Johns River.  In the Big Bend, the OFW rule specifies certain "incorporated and unincorporated areas that are excluded."
Please note that Boca Ciega Bay Aquatic Preserve is also part of the Pinellas County Aquatic Preserve.

<procdesc>In the 2003 update provided by FDEP, the  western boundary of Pinellas County Aquatic Preserve was adjusted to follow the coastline of Pinellas County. Lake Weir was removed. Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve was divided into Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve and Biscayne Bay-Cape Florida to Monroe County Line Aquatic Preserve. Boundaries were broadened for Tomoka Marsh Aquatic Preserve, North Fork St. Lucie Aquatic Preserve, and Loxahatchee Key-Lake Worth Creek Aquatic Preserve. In each case, the description designated all sovereignty submerged lands within specific boundaries. The boundary was extended out to those specific boundaries rather than attempting to determine if the previous boundary actually represented the full extent of sovereign submerged lands.</procdesc>

This is due to either a limitation in the data model used to create the data set, or in some cases, the boundaries of aquatic preserves were drawn as indicated in legal descriptions, and the exact extent of submerged lands within the given boundaries was not verified.
