<abstract>
Phytoplankton and Picoplankton taxon distributions
were obtained from replicate surface and lower
water column composite samples at 15 station,
sampled monthly from January- December  in
Virginia. Stations were located to characterize
phytoplankton composition and abundance in the
lower bay,  Bay mouth system, Virginia tributaries
and southern branch of the Elizabeth River.
</abstract>
<purpose>
The Commonwealth of Virginia, in cooperation with
the US EPA Chesapeake Bay Program, has monitored
plankton species abundance and composition in the
Virginia Chesapeake Bay mainstem and tributaries
since 1985.  The current dataset is designed to
give comprehensive spatial and temporal
information on phytoplankton.

The phytoplankton field chief is the custodian for
all samples collected, and verifies proper
labeling of bottles, complete field data entries,
the collection of the samples, preservative used
and transport to the laboratory.  He also
supervises the calibration and availability of
field equipment. Samples are turned over to the
laboratory chief who oversees the sample
processing, analysis and recording of the raw
data.  Taxon identifications, raw data sheets and
other stages of the collection and analysis
procedures are routinely checked by the principal
investigator and laboratory chief for quality
assurance.

Sampling of tributary stations did not begin until
January 1986. Sampling in the Elizabeth river did
not begin until January of 1989. Sampling at
station SBE2 in the Elizabeth River was
discontinued in January 1998.

Chesapeake Bay Program Sample Analysis Method
PH102.  Upon return to the lab samples had ten
milliliter of buffered formaldehyde added to the
sample and were allowed to settle for 72 hours.  A
three step series of alternating siphoning and
settling followed over the next 72 hours to obtain
twenty to thirty-five milliliter concentrate from
each sample.  The concentrate was brought to a
known volume with distilled water and placed in an
Utermohl settling chamber for examination with an
inverted plankton microscope. The microscopic
examination was performed at three powers. At
magnifications of  X312 and X500 a combined random
field (10) and minimum cell count (200) procedure
is followed where all taxa were counted to the
lowest taxonomic category possible. Cells not
discernible at the lower magnification were
counted at 500X.  In addition the entire
concentrate is scanned at 125X  for net
phytoplankton.  Identifications are based on
internationally accepted plankton keys and
Laboratory voucher specimens. Currently one
replicate sample is counted and one sample is
archived for a two year period.

PP101. Using a Millipore apparatus , a backing
0.45 um nuclepore filter was wetted with distilled
water, was  placed on the Millipore stem.  Then a
0.20 um nuclepore filter, previously stained in an
irgalan black solution was placed over the other
filter. Two milliliters of the shaken water sample
was added to the filter apparatus. Using a pump,
and a maximum vacuum of ten centimeter for
mercury, the sample was filtered until the
meniscus disappears from the top of the filter.
The 0.2 um  nucleopore filter was  removed and
placed immediately on a glass slide previously
moistened by breath. A drop of immersion oil was
placed at the center of the filter, then covered
with a cover slip.  The slide is examined
immediately with a Zeiss Axioskop epifluorescenct
microscope  equipped with a 100 watt mercury lamp
and a 100X oil immersion objective.  The
autotrophic picoplankton were counted using a
"green" filter set (g546. FT580, LP590).  Count
are made on replicate samples and averaged. A
minimum of 200 cells and a minimum coverage of 20
field is counted on each slide.
