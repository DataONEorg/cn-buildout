The Voyageurs National Park Vegetation Mapping
Project is part of the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping
Program, which is managed by the USGS Center for
Biological Informatics.  The USGS UMESC provided
project coordination and compiled all project data
for distribution.  The UMESC produced all spatial
database sets: vegetation spatial database
coverage, observation points, vegetation field
plots, accuracy assessment, and various other
ancillary spatial coverages.  The UMESC also
performed the accuracy assessment analysis of the
vegetation spatial database coverage, prepared
final project documentation discussing methods and
results, and provided metadata reports.  TNC and
their affiliates (ABI and MCBS) provided
ecological and vegetation support, vegetation
field sampling (plot samples and accuracy
assessment), data entry, vegetation analysis,
methods documentation, and classification
development (including community descriptions)
based on the U.S. National Vegetation
Classification (USNVC).  Voyageurs National Park
provided staff to assist in field efforts, boat
transportation, and knowledge of the local area.

<abstract>
Thematic accuracy requirements for the USGS-NPS
Vegetation Mapping Program specify 80% accuracy
for each map unit that represents USNVC floristic
types.  A total of 1288 accuracy assessment (AA)
sites were selected at Voyageurs National Park and
environs for a thematic AA analysis of the
project's vegetation spatial database coverage.
The field data were collected during the summers
of 1997 and 1998.  Data from 1251 sites were used
for the AA analysis.  Sites not used for the
analysis were due to site inaccessibility,
insufficient data collected, significant change in
the landscape, or unmanageable error in the global
positioning system (GPS) coordinate.  Regardless
of the data usability to the analysis, all 1288 AA
sites are represented in the spatial database with
explanations.  The estimated overall accuracy for
the vegetation map units is 82.4%.

Plot sizes ranged from 20 x 20 m for forests and woodlands
to 10 x 10 m for shrublands, herbaceous, and nonvascular
vegetation. Plots were placed subjectively in the most
representative part of each stand of vegetation. The
vegetation was visually divided into strata, and height
and cover abundance of each stratum was estimated. Cover
of dominant life forms was also estimated to match methods
used by the Minnesota Natural Heritage Program survey
methods (e.g. total cover of evergreen trees or shrubs was
recorded separately from cover of deciduous trees or shrubs
(Norm Aaseng, personal communication, 1996). All the
species of each stratum were listed (including mosses and
lichens) and percent cover estimated using the Braun-Blanquet
cover scale. Additional species within the vegetation unit
or polygon that occurred outside of sampled plots
(generally within 2 m of the plot border) were listed
separately. Species that were not identifiable in the field
were collected for later identification. Vegetation plot
data were entered into the Minnesota Natural Heritage
Program's plot database. Species were assigned standardized
codes and names based on the PLANTS database (USDA, NRCS
1999). These data were transferred to the PLOTS database
developed by the Nature Conservancy (TNC 1997) for final
inclusion in this report. For the vegetation analysis, the
data were analyzed using the PC-ORD Multivariate Analysis
package (McCune and Mefford 1997). The data were analyzed
in a series of runs, partitioning the data into smaller
sets based on clusters found in the larger data sets, until
sufficient resolution was achieved. Multivariate analysis
was done using both Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling or
NMS (Clarke 1993) and Cluster Analysis. A Bray-Curtis
ordination was used as a starting point for the NMS and
Ward's Method was used in the Cluster Analysis. These were
then reviewed and assessed for perceived environmental
gradients (e.g. moisture gradients, peat depth, soil depth,
etc.). Indicator Species Analysis (Dufrene and Legendre 1997)
was used to identify indicator species and to assess the
reassignment of plots into different cluster analysis groups.
These groups were compared with the USNVC (Faber-Langendoen
et al. 1996, Grossman et al. 1998), as well as to
northwestern Ontario types (Sims et al. 1989 and 1997,
Harris et al. 1996). Care was taken not to over-emphasize local
variations found at Voyageurs compared to more extensive
information compiled at the state or regional level.
Nevertheless, several types in the USNVC were revised
based on these analyses. Plot summaries were
produced for each type.

SITE SELECTION &amp; FIELD METHODS: The number of
sites selected for field assessment depended on
how common a map unit was, as outlined in the
Program's "Accuracy Assessment Procedures"
document (ESRI, NCGI, &amp; TNC 1994).  Site locations
were stratified as best possible across Voyageurs
National Park and environs based on vegetation map
data available at the time of field assessment.  A
total of 1288 sites were selected for assessment.
AA field data were collected during the 1997 and
1998 field seasons.  During 1997 and early 1998, a
digital database of the polygons was not
available, thus the AA field team relied on copies
of interpreted overlays and aerial photographs to
select sites.  Data for 552 AA sites were
collected using the &amp;#147;overlay&amp;#148; selection method.
During 1997, the focus was in the northern
one-third of the project area.  During early 1998,
the focus was in the Rat Root Peatland and western
Kabetogama Lake.  The AA team chose polygons and
then hiked to them to determine the vegetation
type.  X-Y coordinates were collected with a PLGR
and occasionally a Trimble GPS unit, with
projection in UTM, Zone 15, and datum in North
American Datum of 1927 (NAD27).  Canopy structure,
dominant species by strata, environmental
features, adjacent vegetation types, and rationale
for classification were also recorded on data
sheets.  By the 1998 field season, much of the
polygon data had been digitized, enabling the AA
teams to have a computer-generated selection of
sampling points.  Data for 736 AA sites were
collected using the &amp;#147;digital&amp;#148; selection method.
The majority of the AA sites were selected in the
bottom two-thirds of the project area.  3 times
the number of sites needed were generated so that
1) point locations falling in close proximity to
polygon edges could be eliminated (to reduce
location error due to GPS positional error) and 2)
remote locations of individual points could be
eliminated for logistical matters (staff, time,
and cost issues).  Hard copy 1:12,000-scale
orthophoto quadrangle maps, produced from USGS
3.75-minute digital orthophoto quadrangles
(DOQ's), were plotted with vegetation polygons and
final selection of AA points overlaying the maps.
The orthophoto maps were used to help navigate
across terrain and to help confirm proper site
location.  X-Y coordinates (UTM, Zone 15, NAD83)
for each selected AA site were uploaded into PLGR
units.  Each site was navigated to using PLGR
units.  Once the site was reached, the vegetation
type was determined and additional data (as
described with the prior year's data collection)
were recorded.  All AA data were entered into the
PLOTS database (TNC 1997) and reviewed for errors.
</procdesc>
<procdate>1997-1998</procdate>
</procstep>
<procstep>
<procdesc>
ANALYSIS: 1251 of the 1288 AA sites were used for
the AA analysis.  Some sites could not be reached,
others offered insufficient field data to classify
the vegetation accurately, and others had
unmanageable or missing X-Y coordinates.  A couple
sites were dropped because of changes in the
landscape since date of photograph (tree clearing,
lake drawdown).  Most of the 1997 and some of the
1998 field X-Y coordinates were collected in
NAD27.  These were identified and converted to
NAD83.  The NAD83 X-Y coordinates, along with
selected AA data fields from the PLOTS database,
were intersected with the vegetation spatial
database coverage, producing an output table to
begin a comparison between field classifications
and map units of polygons in which the AA X-Y
coordinate is located.  USNVC associations (using
Community Element Global (CEGL) codes) were
compared to map unit codes.  Mismatches were
investigated to discern true errors from false
errors.  False errors might be a GPS positional
error (placing the point into an adjacent polygon
on the map than the actual field location), a
transition zone offering expressions of more than
one vegetation type, or an inclusion area that was
less than minimum mapping unit within the map
polygon.  Assessment results along with
explanations were preserved in a digital
spreadsheet, and eventually included in the final
spatial database.  Some map units were grouped
together because they represented phases of 1
USNVC association.  Likewise, some CEGL codes were
grouped together because the map unit represents a
USNVC alliance (having 2 or more associations, due
to mapping limitations).  Once a 1:1 relationship
was established between map units and vegetation
types, PROC FREQ (SAS 1996) was used to compare
and tabulate the total number of AA sites and map
polygons that were in agreement.  The numbers were
transferred into a contingency table, where user's
and producer's accuracy percentages were figured
for each map unit.  Based on the results of this
thematic accuracy assessment, the estimated
overall accuracy for vegetation map units is
82.4%.

</procstep>
<procstep>
<procdesc>
SPATIAL DATABASE: The AA sites were collected in
UTM projection, Zone 15.  Some sites were
collected with datum in NAD27, others in NAD83.
The NAD27 X-Y coordinates (most coordinates
collected in 1997 and a few collected in 1998)
were converted to UTM, Zone 15, NAD83 using
ArcInfo (Version 7.2.1 Patch 2).  The look up
table (LUT) containing the AA analysis data and
results (from the ANALYSIS step) was originally
created in Microsoft (R) Excel 97 and then
converted to dBASE IV format (dbf).  The LUT was
imported into ArcView (R) GIS (Version 3.1) as an
Event Theme using the UTM, Zone 15, NAD83 X-Y
coordinates and then converted to a Shapefile
coverage.  USGS 7.5-minute and 3.75-minute
quadrangle boundary names were merged with the AA
site Shapefile coverage using ArcView software.
The Shapefile coverage was then converted to an
ArcInfo coverage using the Shapearc command in
ArcInfo (Version 8.0.2).  ArcInfo was used to
produce the ArcInfo Export file.
