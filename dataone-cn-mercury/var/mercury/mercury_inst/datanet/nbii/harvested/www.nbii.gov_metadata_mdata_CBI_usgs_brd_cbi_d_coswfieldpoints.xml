<abstract>
Vegetation field plots at Congaree Swamp National Monument were visited,
described, and documented in a digital database. The database
consists of 2 parts - (1) Physical Descriptive Data, and (2) Species Listings.
</abstract>
<purpose>
The vegetation plots were used to describe the vegetation in and around
Congaree Swamp National Monument and to assist in developing a
final mapping classification system.
</purpose>
<supplinf>
On June 30, 1983, Congaree Swamp National Monument
became an International Biosphere Reserve.
Congaree is noted for containing one of the last
significant stands of old growth bottomland
hardwood forest, over 11,000 acres in all.  The
Monument contains over 90 species of trees, 16 of
which hold state records for size.  Included in
this list of records is a national record sweet
gum with a basal circumference of nearly 20 feet.

Congaree Swamp National Monument is located
approximately 15 miles southeast of Columbia, the
state capitol of South Carolina.  Old Bluff
Highway (old Highway 48) lies just north of the
Monument boundary.  The eastern boundary is
located just northwest of the confluence of the
Congaree and Wateree Rivers.  The Monument extends
west to where Cedar Creek and Myers Creek join.

The criteria differs primarily in that the height
and density variables were not mapped at Congaree
Swamp.  Instead, two additional variables were
addressed:
pre-hurricane Hugo community types and areas of
pine that have been logged since the time of the
1976 aerial photography.

The methods used for the sampling and analysis of vegetation data
and the development of the classification generally followed the
standards outline in the Field Methods for Vegetation Mapping
document &lt;http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/fieldmethods/index.html&gt;
produced for the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping project.  This process
began with the development of a provisional list of twenty-five
vegetation types from the International Classification of Ecological
Communities (ICEC) that were thought to have a high likelihood of
being in the park based on an initial field visit on 13-14 June, 1996.
One hundred twenty-eight plots were sampled by two two-person field
teams in July, August, and September of 1996.  In a deviation from
the methodology outlined in the Field Methods document, initial sample
points were selected in order to have plots in each of the aerial
photograph signature types.  The gradsect approach was rejected because
there appeared to be no potential for stratifying sampling of the park
based on slope, aspect, elevation, soil or other natural features due
to a lack of available information.  Furthermore, because of isolation
from roads and trails of many portions of the park, it was deemed not
feasible to use a transect to establish plot locations.  After sampling,
plots were tentatively assigned to the ICEC at the alliance level and
our goal was to have at least five plots in each of the twenty-five
provisional vegetation types.  Time limitations precluded the ability
of the field teams to install ten plots in each of the expected
vegetation types as recommended in the Field Methods document.
During field reconnaissance in mid-July 1996, it appeared that there
could be a geographic segregation, possibly by drainage, within the
Monument of the vegetation types at the NVCS association level so
the methodology for establishing plots was modified.  In an effort to
ensure that the full range of vegetation was sampled, we stratified
the Monument into six zones by drainages and made sure that each
signature or vegetation type was sampled at least once in each zone in
which it occurred.  Plots were subjectively placed using two criteria:
first, that the plot be as near the middle of the delineated polygon as
feasible; and second, and more importantly, that the plot be located
within a homogeneous, representative portion of the polygon.  Where a
complete 20x50 meter plot would not fit within the representative area,
a smaller plot size was used.  Number of plots and plot size varied by
community and by number of aerial photograph signatures assigned to a
vegetation type.  Generally, more widespread communities had more plots
than rarer ones, and types represented by more than one photo signature
had more plots than those with a monotypic signature.
The final vegetation classification and descriptions were produced using
the plot data.  The data were analyzed using an ordination technique,
Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA), and a clustering algorithm,
Unweighted Pair-Group Method Using Arithmetic Means (UPGMA).  These
clusters were used to derive the final classification units.  Field
experience and judgment were used while reviewing the fit of each plot
within the cluster to which it was assigned.  As a result, some plots
were placed in clusters other than those to which they were initially
assigned based on the quantitative data analyses.

Physical Descriptive Data:
Plot Code: This field is the unique identifier for a Plot record.  It is
generated by the system, at the time a new record  is entered into
the database.  The Plot Code is assembled from two parts: the
Location Code and the Plot Code Counter, which is a sequential
counter field that is increased automatically each time a Plot is
entered for that Location. The sequential counter can be reset to
any number you would like.
SubPlot: ‘yes&amp;#146; if the plot is a subplot of another larger plot. Blank if
the plot is not a subplot of another plot.
Polygon Code: Code indicating the vegetation polygon where the plot was
taken.  This is entered only if working from previously delineated
photos.
Provisional Community Name: The name of the vegetation type which most
closely resembles this type using the classification system.
Entered at the finest level of the classification possible.  This
is meant to be a field call of the vegetation classification and
may change when the data are analyzed.  Colloquial names can be
used in this field if necessary.
Classified Community Name: The community name from the National
Vegetation Classification System, once the data are analyzed and
the community has been classified.
TNC Elcode: The Elcode (Element Code) for the community element
corresponding to the Classified Community Name.
Quad Name: Appropriate name/scale from survey map used; 7.5 minute
quadrangle used if possible.
Quad Code: Code of USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle map.
GPS Techniques: (empty) The projection and GPS datum, plus any

specified in the Plot Shape field.  *NOTE:  Dimensions MUST be
converted to meters.
Y Dimension: The length in meters* of the side of the plot adjacent to
the side entered in the X Dimension field.  The value entered in
the Y Dimension field should correspond to the plot referred to in
the Plot Shape  and X Dimension  fields.  Leave this field blank if
the plot is circular.  Enter a one if a transect was used.  *NOTE:
Dimensions MUST be converted to meters.
Plot Shape: Shape which best describes that used for this sample.
Possible values are "rectangular", "square", "circular",
"transect/strip", "Other"

Landform: A descriptive term for the landform characteristics of the
area.
Surficial Geology: a term that describes the geologic substrate
influencing the plant community (bedrock or surficial materials).
Cowardin System: "Upland" if the system is not a wetland, if wetland,
the name of the USFWS system which best describes its hydrology and
landform.  Values include
"ESTUARINE" = Deepwater tidal habitats and adjacent tidal wetlands
that are usually semienclosed by land but have open, partly
obstructed, or sporadic access to the open ocean, and in which
ocean water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater
runoff from the land.  The salinity is above 0.5 parts per
thousand, and may be periodically increased above that of the
open ocean by evaporation.  Along some low energy coastlines
there is appreciable dilution of sea water.  Off shore areas
with typical estuarine plants and animals, such as red
mangroves and eastern oysters are also included in the
Estuarine System.  The presence of halophytic plants may be
used to differentiate Estuarine from other freshwater systems
if there is insufficient data on salinity.
"PALUSTRINE" = Nontidal wetlands dominated by trees, shrubs,
persistent emergents, emergent mosses or lichens, and all such
wetlands that occur in tidal areas where salinity due to ocean
derived salts is below 0.5 parts per thousand.  It also
includes wetlands lacking such vegetation, but with all of the
following four characteristics: (1) area less than 8 ha (20
acres); (2) active waveformed or bedrock shoreline features
lacking; (3) water depth in the deepest part of basin less
than 2m at low water; and salinity due to ocean derived salts
less than 0.5 parts per thousand.
"RIVERINE" = Includes all wetlands and deepwater habitats contained
within a channel, with two exceptions: (1) wetland dominated
by trees, shrubs, persistent emergents, emergent mosses, or
lichens, and (2) habitats with water containing ocean derived
salts in excess of 0.5 parts per thousand.  A channel is "an
open conduit either naturally or artificially created which
periodically on continuously contains moving water, or which
forms a connecting link between two bodies of standing water".
"LACUSTRINE" = Includes wetlands and deepwater habitats with all of
the following characteristics: (1) situated in a topographic
depression or a dammed river channel; (2) lacking trees,
shrubs, persistent emergents, emergent mosses or lichens with
greater than 30% areal coverage: and (3) total area exceeds 8
ha (20 acres).  Similar wetland and deepwater habitats
totaling less than 8 ha are also included in the Lacustrine
System if an active waveformed or bedrock shoreline feature
makes up all or part of the boundary, or if the water depth in
the deepest part of the basin exceeds 2 m (6.6 feet) at low
water.  Lacustrine waters may be tidal or nontidal, but ocean
derived salinity is always less than 0.5 parts per thousand.
Hydro Regime: The appropriate term from the following possible values
"SEMIPERMANENTLY FLOODED" = Surface water persists throughout
growing season in most years except during periods of drought.
Land surface is normally saturated when water level drops
below soil surface.  Includes Cowardin's Intermittently
Exposed and Semipermanently Flooded modifiers.
"SEASONALLY FLOODED" = Surface water is present for extended
periods during the growing season, but is absent by the end of
the growing season in most years.  The water table after
flooding ceases is very variable, extending from saturated to
a water table well below the ground surface.  Includes
Cowardin's Seasonal, Seasonal-Saturated, and Seasonal-Well
Drained modifiers.
"SATURATED" = Surface water is seldom present, but substrate is
saturated to surface for extended periods during the growing
season.  Equivalent to Cowardin's Saturated modifier.
"TEMPORARILY FLOODED" = Surface water present for brief periods
during growing season, but water table usually lies well below
soil surface.  Often characterizes flood-plain wetlands.
Equivalent to Cowardin's Temporary modifier.
"INTERMITTENTLY FLOODED" = Substrate is usually exposed, but
surface water can be present for variable periods without
detectable seasonal periodicity.  Inundation is not
predictable to a give season and is dependent upon highly
localized rain storms.  this modifier was developed for use in
the arid West for water regimes of Playa lakes, intermittent
streams, and dry washes but can be used in other parts of the
U.S. where appropriate.  This modifier can be applied to both
wetland and non-wetland situations.  Equivalent to Cowardin's
Intermittently Flooded modifier.
"PERMANENTLY FLOODED" = Water covers the land surface at all times
of the year in all years.  Equivalent to Cowardin's
"permanently flooded".
"PERMANENTLY FLOODED TIDAL" = Salt water covers the land surface at
all times of the year in all years.  This modifier applies
only to permanently flooded areas irregularly flooded by fresh
tidal water.  Equivalent to Cowardin's "permanently
flooded/tidal".
"TIDALLY FLOODED" = flooded by the alternate rise and fall of the
surface of oceans, seas, and the bays, rivers, etc. connected
to them, caused by the attraction of the moon and sun or by
the back-up of water caused by unfavorable winds.
"UNKNOWN" = The water regime of the area is not known.  The unit
is simply described as "(wetland)'.
Salinity/Halinity: Possible values include
Coastal Tidal: Saltwater - tidal = &gt; 30 ppt
Coastal Tidal: Brackish = 0.5 - 30 ppt
Coastal Tidal: Freshwater = &lt; 0.5 ppt
Inland: Saltwater = &gt; 30 ppt
Inland: Brackish = 0.5 - 30 ppt

Soil Drainage: Soil drainage classes are defined in terms of (1) actual
moisture content (in excess of field moisture capacity), and (2)
the extent of the period during which excess water is present in
the plant root zone.  It is recognized that permeability, level of
groundwater, and seepage are factors affecting moisture status.
However, because these are not easily observed or measured in the
field, they cannot be used generally as criteria of moisture
status.  It is further recognized that soil profile morphology, for
example mottling, normally, but not always, reflects soil moisture
status.  Although soil morphology may be a valuable field
indication of moisture status, it should not be the overriding
criterion.  Soil drainage classes cannot be based solely on the
presence or absence of mottling.  Topographic position and
vegetation as well as soil morphology are useful field criteria for
assessing soil moisture status.
RAPIDLY DRAINED - The soil moisture content seldom exceeds field
capacity in any horizon except immediately after water
addition.  Soils are free from any evidence of gleying
throughout the profile.  Rapidly drained soils are commonly
coarse textured or soils on steep slopes.
WELL DRAINED - The soil moisture content does not normally exceed
field capacity in any horizon (except possibly the C) for a
significant part of the year.  Soils are usually free from
mottling in the upper 3 feet, but may be mottled below this
depth.  B horizons, if present, are reddish, brownish, or
yellowish.
MODERATELY WELL DRAINED - The soil moisture in excess of field
capacity remains for a small but significant period of the
year.  Soils are commonly mottled (chroma &lt; 2) in the lower B
and C horizons or below a depth of 2 feet.  The Ae horizon, if
present, may be faintly mottled in fine textured soils and in
medium textured soils that have a slowly permeable layer below
the solum.  In grassland soils the B and C horizons may be
only faintly mottled and the A horizon may be relatively thick
and dark.
SOMEWHAT POORLY DRAINED - The soil moisture in excess of field
capacity remains in subsurface horizons for moderately long
periods during the year.  Soils are commonly mottled in the B
and C horizons; the Ae horizon, if present, may be mottled.
The matrix generally has a lower chroma than in the well
drained soil on similar parent material.
POORLY DRAINED - The soil moisture in excess of field capacity
remains in all horizons for a large part of the year.  The
soils are usually very strongly gleyed.  Except in high chroma
parent materials the B, if present, and upper C horizons
usually have matrix colors of low chroma.  Faint mottling may
occur throughout.
VERY POORLY DRAINED - Free water remains at or within 12 inches of
the surface most of the year.  The soils are usually very
strongly gleyed.  Subsurface horizons usually are of low
chroma and yellowish to bluish hues.  Mottling may be present
but at depth in the profile.  Very poorly drained soils
usually have a mucky or peaty surface horizon.
Leaf Phenology: The value which best describes the leaf phenology of the
dominant stratum.
EVERGREEN - Greater than 75% of the total woody cover is never
without green foliage.
DECIDUOUS - Greater than 75% of the total woody cover sheds its
foliage simultaneously in connection with the unfavorable
season.
COLD DECIDUOUS - Unfavorable season mainly characterized by winter
frost.
DROUGHT DECIDUOUS - Unfavorable season mainly characterized by
drought, in most cases winter-drought.  Foliage is shed
regularly every year.  Most trees with relatively thick,
fissured bark.
MIXED EVERGREEN - DECIDUOUS - Evergreen and deciduous species
generally contribute 5-75% of the total woody cover.
MIXED EVERGREEN / COLD DECIDUOUS - Evergreen and cold-deciduous
species admixed.
MIXED EVERGREEN / DROUGHT DECIDUOUS - Evergreen and drought-
deciduous species admixed.
HERB - PERENNIAL - Herbaceous vegetation composed of more than 50%
perennial species.
HERB - ANNUAL - Herbaceous vegetation composed of more than 50%
annual species.
Leaf Type: The value which best describes the leaf form of the dominant stratum.
BROADLEAF - Woody vegetation primarily broadleaved (generally
contribute to greater than 50% of the total woody cover).

relative percent cover and height of the lifeform comprising the
uppermost strata with cover greater than 0%.  (Note: Percent canopy
cover and height ranges are provided as guidelines, not strict
cutoff points).

Species Listing Data for Plots:
Plot Code: This field is the unique identifier for a Plot record.  It is
generated by the system, at the time a new record  is entered into
the database.  The Plot Code is assembled from two parts: the
Location Code and the Plot Code Counter, which is a sequential
counter field that is increased automatically each time a Plot is
entered for that Location. The sequential counter can be reset to
any number you would like.
Plant Symbol: The symbol field provides a quick and easy way to search
for a species name in the PLANTS database.  It generally consists
of the first two characters of the Genus name, plus the first two
characters of the Species name.  Identical symbol codes that are
for different species names are appended with tie-breaker
characters.
Scientific Name: The scientific name for an individual species record
within the NRCS PLANTS Database.  As supplied by the NRCS, this
field also contains authority information.  This field is used as
validation data when a species' name is entered into the Species
Scientific Name field in either the Plots or the AA Observations
table.
Common Name: The common name for an individual species record within the
NRCS PLANTS Database.
Family: The family name for an individual species within the NRCS PLANTS
Database.
Used PLANTS: This field will be automatically checked if the name
appearing in the Species Scientific Name field is found in the
PLANTS database.  Note that the automatic check-off will only
take place if there is an exact match between the Species Scientific Name
and the name as listed in PLANTS.
Source: This field indicates the source of the name record in the PLANTS
Database.  Values are:
SS=Standard Source (e.g. the NRCS PLANTS list),
NS=Non-standard Source (any source other than NRCS),
SY=Accepted synonym by NRCS list.
Within Plot:
Stratum Sort:  The stratum in which this species occurs.  T1=Emergent Tree,
T2= Tree Canopy, T3=Tree Subcanopy, S1=Tall Shrub (&gt;5m),
S2=Short Shrub (&lt;2m), S3=Dwarf-Shrub, H=Herbaceous, N=Nonvascular,
E=Epiphyte, V=Vine/Liana.
Diagnostic: This is to be checked if the species is known to be
diagnostic of the vegetation type.
