<descript>
<abstract>
Vegetation field plots at Isle Royale National Park were
visited, described, and documented in a digital
database.  The database consists of 2 parts -
(1) Physical Descriptive Data and (2) Species Listings.
</abstract>
<purpose>
The vegetation plots were used to describe the
vegetation in and around Wind Cave National Park and
to assist in developing a final mapping classification
system.
Provide National Parks with the necessary tools to
effectively manage their natural resources.  Plot
data are collected and analyzed to develop
a classification (using the Standardized National
Vegetation Classification System) and description
of vegetation types in preparation for
photointerpretation and mapping of the Park's
vegetation types.
</purpose>
<supplinf>
Isle Royale National Park was authorized on March
3, 1931; it was formally established in 1940, and
officially dedicated in 1946.  Most of the park's
land area (98%) was designated as a Wilderness
area in October 1976, and later additions
increased the total Wilderness to 99% of the park.
The park was designated an International
Biosphere Reserve in 1980.

Isle Royale National Park, Michigan and environs.
Isle Royale National Park is an archipelago of
islands located in the northwestern region of Lake
Superior close to the United States-Canada border.
The park is located about 60 miles northwest of
Michigan&amp;#146;s Keweenaw Peninsula, about 22 miles east
of Grand Portage, Minnesota, and about 35 miles
southeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario.

plot survey date, surveyor's name, length, width,
photo type, elevation, slope aspect, topographic
position, landform, surface geology, Cowardin

One species is entered per line, by plot code,

complete for each row, but some species codes,
cover and strata information is missing (because
it was not present on the original field forms).

The following describes the tasks performed by The
Nature Conservancy to produce descriptive data for
182 vegetation sampling plots in two separate
database files.  The second of the three contains
listings of individual species found in each plot,
along with height and cover estimates, and strata
delineations.  The SPECIES LISTING database
contains line entries for each species including
the Plot Code, Numeric species code, full
scientific species name, cover estimate, a unique
alphnumeric species identifier (plant code),
listings of individual strata found in each plot,
along with cover estimates and height (strata)
delineations. The STRATA LISTING database contains
line entries for each strata including the Plot
Code, full species name, height, cover, and Strata
delineation.   Plot sites were
selected subjectively because of the heterogeneity
of the vegetation and the small number of samples
per type.  Since aerial photos were not available
at the time of plot selection, visual
reconnaissance was conducted at  the summit of the
bluff to examine vegetation patterns for
the purpose of plot placement.  Plot data were
manually recorded on field forms on-site, and
subsequently keyed into the database files
described herein.  Information in the plot
database was then used to develop
the classification system and plant identification
keys contained in the ISLE ROYALE SAMPLING
AND CLASSIFICATION REPORT.

Each of 182 vegetation plots has attributes for
physical  description, species and strata.
Physical description - (Plot  number, plot code,
common name, scientific name, state, park  name,
quad name, utm zone, map project, gps file,
raw utm x, raw  utm y, corrected utm x,
corrected utm y, surveyors date, surveyors, length,
width, photos, permanent, elevation, slope,  aspect,
topographical position, landform, surficial geology,
cowardin system type, hydrography, bedrock,
large rock, small  rock, sand, litter duff, wood,
bare soil, other soil, soil texture, soil drainage,
leaf phenology, leaf type, and  physiology).
Species - (sp_code is a project specific code for
each species found, species is the scientific name
for that  species, spcover is the species present
and the percent cover for each species, plant code
is the first two letters of the  genus and first
two letters of the species. If the code are not
unique a number is added to make the code unique).
Strata -  (height and cover are average percent
cover of that particular species, 1 = 0-10%,
2 = 10-25%, 3 = 25-60% and 4 = 60-100%,
pstrata is the type of vegetation, T1 = emergent,
T2 = canopy, T3  = sub-canopy, S1 = tall shrub,
S2 = short shrub, H = herbaceous, N = non-vascular,
V = vine/liana, and E = epiphyte).
