<abstract>Rangelands are found on all continents, covering up to 30-50% of the earth's surface. Most rangelands in the western states are water-limited ecosystems. Therefore small changes in precipitation amount or season may affect biological components that maintain nutrient and water cycles within these ecosystems and energy flow through these ecosystems. The climate of the Intermountain West is generally semi-arid with most of the precipitation during the winter. Global circulation models often predict a shift of the summer monsoon storm track to the north into the Intermountain West. Resource managers have stressed the need to predict changes to ecosystems that might occur with shifts in global circulation patterns. The effects of climate shifts on lands where human-induced impacts, such as livestock grazing, occur may result in interactions that will accelerate or cancel the effects predicted by climate alone. Livestock impacts go beyond just herbivory to include trampling and nutrient redistribution that may affect various ecosystem properties differentially. We will determine: A) the sensitivity and responses of physical, chemical, and biological components along a series of environmental gradients of soil types, precipitation timing, and evapo-transpiration gradients in semi-arid ecosystems of the Intermountain West; B) the effect various climate and grazing scenarios will have on the ability for ecosystems to sustain current levels of plant productivity, functional composition and C and N pools for the next 50-500 years as well as to predict the response of invertebrates to changes in C and N with grazing and climate change; and C) the potential impacts of selected policy decisions regarding livestock grazing in the Intermountain West.</abstract>
