<abstract>
Vegetation field plots at Tuzigoot NM were visited, described, and
documented in a digital database. The database consists of 3 parts -
(1)Physical Descriptive Data, (2) Species Listings, and (3) Vegetative
Strata.
</abstract>
<purpose>
Provide National Parks with the necessary tools to effectively manage
their natural resources. Plot data are collected and analyzed to develop a
classification (using the Standardized National Vegetation Classification
System) and description of vegetation types in preparation for
photointerpretation and mapping of the monument's vegetation types.

Physical description - Descriptive plot data were collected for 35 sites whose
vegetation represents a full spectrum of alliance types present within Tuzigoot
National Monument and its immediate surroundings. Attributes collected for
each site include: a unique plot identification code, park name, quad
name, UTM coordinates, UTM projection, plot survey date, surveyor's name,
length, width, photo type, elevation, slope aspect, topographic position,
landform, surface geology, Cowardin System category, hydrology, surface
material description, soil texture, soil drainage, leaf phenology, leaf
type, and physiognomy. Species - Descriptive plot data were collected for 35
sites whose vegetation represents a full spectrum of alliance types present
within Tuzigoot National Monument and its immediate surroundings. This
database which is the second of three databases containing plot field data,
delineates species. Individual species described at each of 35 plots is listed,
one line per species, with the following information: Plot Identification
Code, Species Name, Species Cover ( 0=trace, 1=&lt; 1%, 2=1-5%, 3=5-25%,
4=25-50%, 5=50-75%, 6=75-100%), Plantcode (first 2 letters of genus+first
2 letters of spp.), and Plant Strata (T, S, H, v.s, and no entry). Strata -
Descriptive plot data were collected for 35 sites whose vegetation
represents a full spectrum of alliance types present within Tuzigoot
National Monument and its immediate surroundings. This database which is
the third of three databases containing plot field data, delineates plot
strata. Most of the 35 plots have multiple strata, with each listed as a
separate line entry in the database. Strata are described by plot code,
descriptive name, height, cover, and an alpha-numeric strata code.
Descriptive names include canopy, sub-canopy, tall shrub, short shrub,
herbaceous, and emergent. Height classes, in meters, range from 1 to 7:
1=&lt;0.5 m, 2=0.5-1m, 3=1-2m, 4=2-5m, 5=5-10m, 6=10-15m and 7=15-20m. Cover
groupings, in percent, range from 1 to 4: 1=0-10%, 2=10-25%, 3=25-60%, and
4=60-100%. The diagnostic species for each stratum is listed by latin
name. Stratum codes are defined in the following manner: T1=emergent,
T2=canopy, T3=sub-canopy, S1=tall shrub, S2=short shrub, and H=herbaceous.
</attraccr>

Entries for each of the listed attributes are in the form of consistent
groupings of either textual or numerical descriptors as described under
2.1.1: attribute accuracy report. NOTE1: The significance of numbers
appended to some of the Plant Codes is not known. NOTE2: entries under Plant
Strata were not clearly defined on the original field forms. It is assumed
that T=tree, S=shrub, and H=herbaceous. It is also assumed that numbers
represent canopy levels (starting with 1 as tallest), v.s. = very short.
Plant strata entries in this database are not always consistent with these
assumed labeling conventions.

Physical description - Descriptive entries for each of the 35 plots are

missing plant code in plot 95ROS29. According to convention, the code should

The following describes the tasks performed by The Nature Conservancy to
produce descriptive data for 35 vegetation sampling plots in three
separate database files. The first of the three contains general
descriptive information at each of the plots. Plot sites were selected
by information obtained during a reconnaissance visit to the park in
April of 1995, and by examining tone and textural patterns on the TUZI
AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS. Site physical parameters, species types, and
vegetation strata were described at each site. The PLOTS database
contains tabulations of site physical factors, listed under
the ATTRIBUTE ACCURACY REPORT for each of the 35 plots. Plot data were
manually recorded on field forms on-site, and subsequently keyed into
the database files described herein. Information in the plot database
was then used to develop the classification system and plant
identification keys contained in the TNC TUZI SAMPLING AND
CLASSIFICATION REPORT.

<eaover>
Each of 35 vegetation plots has attributes for physical description, species and
strata. Physical description - (Plot number, plot code, common name, scientific
name, state, park name, quad name, utm zone, map project,
gps file, raw utm x, raw utm y, corrected utm x, corrected utm y, surveyors date,
surveyors, length, width, photos, permanent, elevation, slope, aspect,
topographical position, landform, surficial geology, Cowardin system type,
hydrography, bedrock, large rock, small rock, sand, litter duff, wood, bare soil,
other soil, soil texture, soil drainage, leaf phenology, leaf type, and
physiology). Species - (sp_code is a project specific code for each species found,
species is the scientific name for that species, spcover is the species present and
the percent cover for each species, plant code is the first two letters of the genus
and first two letters of the species. If the code are not unique a number is
added to make the code unique). Strata - (height and cover are average percent cover
of that particular species, 1 = 0-10%, 2 = 10-25%, 3 = 25-60% and 4 = 60-100%,
pstrata is the type of vegetation, T1 = emergent, T2 = canopy, T3 = sub-canopy, S1 =
tall shrub, S2 = short shrub, H = herbaceous, N = non-vascular, V = vine/liana, and E
= epiphyte). Species - Each of 35 vegetation mapping plot sites has attributes of
species found. Strata - Plot strata are defined according to plot identification code,
physiognomic descriptors, height and cover estimates, diagnostic species,
and an alphanumeric structure code. Plot strata information in the
database is listed by plot identification code, with most plots containing
multiple strata. Descriptive factors include physiognomic type, height and
cover estimates, latin name of diagnostic plant species, and a strata code
delineating type and structure.
