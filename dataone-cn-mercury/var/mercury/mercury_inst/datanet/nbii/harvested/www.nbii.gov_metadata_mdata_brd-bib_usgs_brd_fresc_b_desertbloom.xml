<abstract>Most lands in the Western United States, once isolated and rarely visited, have undergone escalating use since the late 1800s. The current combination of land use (including grazing, recreation, military activities, and agriculture) is leading to unprecedented levels of surface disturbance on land in arid and semiarid regions. U.S. Geological Survey researchers Jayne Belnap, Richard Reynolds, Marith Reheis, and Susan Phillips have been studying the importance of eolian dust (windblown silt and clay) and biological soil crusts to ecosystem functioning of arid lands in the Colorado Plateau. In a recent paper, these scientists demonstrate how the biological soil crusts in the Colorado Plateau region act to trap and stabilize eolian dust, which is extremely high in vital plant nutrients, thus enhancing soil nutrient status. This is an important discovery to add to previous findings which demonstrated how the biological soil crusts in the Colorado Plateau region enhance and maintain soil fertility through carbon and nitrogen fixation, dust trapping, and soil stabilization. Unfortunately, the process of biological crusts accumulating eolian dust is extremely slow, and increased disturbance to these lands is resulting in losses from erosion that may never be regained.</abstract>
