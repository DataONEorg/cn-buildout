<abstract>
This data set includes the nearshore bathymetry of the state of Florida as lines representing bathymetric contours. These data are a statewide compilation of the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute's regional nearshore bathymetry contours.
Geonex digitized the contours during 1991-1992 from clean, wrinkle-free paper National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) nautical charts. Geonex used the most current versions of the charts available at that time. The source charts used to create this data set varied in scale from 1:10000 to 1:80000, but in all cases, the largest scale charts available were used. Geonex staff members also interpolated additional contours not present on the charts.
</abstract>
<purpose>This data set was created to represent marine depth contours and depth range polygons, primarily for cartographic purposes.</purpose>
<supplinf>
Prior to July 1, 2004, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) was known as the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI). The institute name has not been changed in historical data sets or references to work completed by the Florida Marine Research Institute. The institute name has been changed in references to ongoing research, new research, and contact information.
These data may contain attribute and positional inaccuracies.  These data were compiled from the original 1992 coverages; they do not reflect any positional or attribute edits that have been made individually to the regional data sets.
These data are not to be used for navigation.  User should be aware that later versions of the source charts may be available and that contours may have changed.  Consult the appropriate coast pilot and the most recent paper or digital charts available.

GEONEX gave these data to FWRI as regional coverages.  FWRI appended these coverages in ArcInfo to make the statewide data set.
