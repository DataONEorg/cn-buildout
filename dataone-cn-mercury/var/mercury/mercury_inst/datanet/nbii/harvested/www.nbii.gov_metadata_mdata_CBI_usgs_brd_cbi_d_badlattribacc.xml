<abstract>
This metadata is for the accuracy assessment data
associated with the vegetation land cover and land use
geospatial database for Badlands National Park and
surrounding areas.  The project is authorized as
part of the USGS/NPS Vegetation Mapping Program
(http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg). The program is
being administered by the Biological Resources
Division (BRD) of the United States Geological
Survey (USGS).  The USGS/BRD is responsible for
overall management and oversight of all ongoing
mapping efforts.  This mapping effort was
performed by the US Bureau of Reclamation's (USBR)
Remote Sensing and GIS Group, Technical Service
Center, Denver, CO. The vegetation mapping program
is part of a larger Inventory and Monitoring (I&amp;M)
program started by the National Park Service (NPS)
Their website is : http://www1.nature.nps.gov/im/
</abstract>
<purpose>
The purposes of the mapping effort are varied and
include the following: Provides support for NPS
Resources Management; Promotes vegetation-related
research for both NPS and USGS/BRD; Provides
support for NPS Planning and Compliance; Adds to
the information base for NPS Interpretation; and
Assists in NPS Operations.  The NPS  I&amp;M goals
are, among others, to map the vegetation of all
national parks and monuments and provide a
baseline inventory of vegetation.

Overall, initial accuracy of the vegetation map is 80.6%
for all vegetation classes and the Kappa Index is 78.2%.
Results for each vegetation class are discussed here,
and recommendations are made relative to creating a more
accurate vegetation map, as desired.
The specific results are presented in Tables 5 and 6
in the "USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program, Badlands
National Park, South Dakota Methodology Report"
(http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/badl/report.pdf#assessment).
In general, the percentage of the Park that an individual
map class covered is reflected in the number of AA
points collected for that type. For example, map
class 16-19 (Western Wheatgrass Alliance / Western
Wheatgrass - Green Needlegrass Grassland) covers
approximately 38% of the Park, and is represented by 29%
of the AA points, and map Class 1 (Prairie Dog Town
Complex) occupies approximately 2% of the Park and is
represented by 3% of the AA points. An exception for
this is map class 2 (Badlands Sparse Vegetation Complex),
which covers approximately 46% of the Park but is
represented by only 14% of the AA points.
Two rare shrub classes were either not assessed or
lightly assessed, due to their lack of abundance
within the Park. These include map class 33
(Rabbitbrush Shrubland), which was not assessed and
map class 38 (Sandbar Willow Temporarily Flooded
Shrubland), which had one AA point but the polygon was
attributed with a land use type; map class 56
(intermittent stream).

AA data, including limited habitat and vegetation data,
was recorded on field forms to document the
classification decision made by the investigator. This
form was modified and expanded from previous forms to
include fields for additional community types found
within 50 meters of the actual assessment point.
Modifications were made to help accommodate several
types of difficult situations, such as AA points
located in small inclusions, heterogeneous
polygons/stands, and GPS PLGR error.
465 AA data points were collected during August 1998.
The weather at this time was unusually warm and
vegetation readily identifiable unless heavily grazed.
In the Park's North Unit, an extremely heavy growth of
yellow sweetclover was present over most grassland and
shrub communities. While noted during the AA sampling,
very little yellow sweetclover was present during the
previous year (1997), the year of aerial photography
acquisition and interpretation. AA points were collected
in proportion to the size of the plant association/ map
class within the Park; e.g. more points were collected
within extensive types.
All accuracy data points were entered into a digital
coverage and overlayed electronically onto final
vegetation maps (by DOQQ).

Accuracy assessment of the BADL project area was
conducted in September 1999. This involved entering all
accuracy data points into a digital coverage and
overlaying these electronically onto final vegetation
maps (by DOQQ). AA identification numbers plotted
alongside each point allowed for comparison with
accuracy assessment data forms. A contingency table was
set up to record the reference data (collected in the
field) versus the sample data (vegetation map) for each
map unit.
Errors of commission (i.e. user's errors) for each class
were calculated by dividing the number of correctly
classified samples by the total number of samples that
were classified as belonging to that map class. Errors
of omission (i.e. producer's errors) for each class were
calculated by dividing the number of samples that were
classified correctly by the total number of reference
samples in that class. Confidence intervals for each
map class were calculated using one of the methods shown
in Table 2 (USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping, Badlands
National Park, South Dakota, Methodology Report)
depending on the normality and size of the data.
Overall total accuracy for BADL was calculated across
all sampled map classes by dividing the number of
correctly classified accuracy points by the total
number of accuracy points. Confidence intervals for
overall total accuracy were calculated using the
equation for normally distributed data (see above).
A Kappa Index (Foody 1992) was used to help account
for any correct classification due to chance.
A total of 458 accuracy assessment points were used to
assess the accuracy of the BADL vegetation map by:
using AA points collected during the summer of
1998 (front-loading method);
entering AA point coordinates into an electronic
format to overlay on the vegetation map;
comparing map vegetation classification
(transferred from photo interpretation) with
field assessment of vegetation type to determine
errors of omission and commission;
resolving questions by referring to original data
forms, so that Dr. Butler could make the final
determination; recording all information on the AA matrix.
Overall, initial accuracy of the vegetation map is 80.6%
for all vegetation classes and the Kappa Index is 78.2%.
Results for each vegetation class are discussed here,
and recommendations are made relative to creating a more
accurate vegetation map, as desired.
The specific results are presented in Tables 5 and 6
below. In general, the percentage of the Park that an
individual map class covered is reflected in the number

class 16-19 (Western Wheatgrass Alliance / Western

The accuracy assessment (AA) for the BADL vegetation
mapping project consisted of preliminary planning and
discussion, logistical planning, fieldwork, analysis of
fieldwork, and computation of final results. Preliminary
planning involved BOR/RSGIG and Dr. Jack Butler (a plant
ecologist contracted to collect the field AA data).
Following detailed discussion, a modified accuracy
assessment procedure dubbed "front-loading" (Owens 1998)
was selected using protocols outlined in the Accuracy
Assessment Procedures (TNC 1994).
The following guidelines for the AA procedure were
adopted at this time:
Observations of vegetation classes were to be
ground-based.
Ground sampling techniques were to be similar to
the Observation Points collected during initial
classification.
The number of samples per plant association/map
class would vary depending on abundance of the
class upon the landscape.
No maximum number of points was assigned so that
the Park could be sampled as completely as possible.
Logistical planning for the AA revolved around
coordination of work schedules and finding reasonable
work areas within the Park. Collection of AA points was
confined to within Park boundaries but not limited to
the previously described gradsects. Instead, AA's were
based on availability of access and to a lesser extent,
time constraints. The actual assessment was begun prior
to completion of preliminary vegetation maps for the
Park, thus the need for the front-loading of the sample
points. Selecting random AA sampling sites beforehand
was deemed unnecessary due to familiarity of the
principal researcher with vegetation types and
distribution at BADL. The final point chosen for
assessment was selected to be as representative as
possible of the vegetation in the immediate area, well
away from stand boundaries, and in a stand larger than
the minimum mapping unit (exceptions were made for
wetland and some shrub classes which rarely exceeded 0.5
hectares in size). Field ecologists were supplied with a
vegetation key, to be used to determine plant
associations/map classes entered on field forms.
AA data, including limited habitat and vegetation data,
was recorded on field forms to document the
classification decision made by the investigator. This
form was modified and expanded from previous forms to
include fields for additional community types found
within 50 meters of the actual assessment point.
Modifications were made to help accommodate several
types of difficult situations, such as AA points located
in small inclusions, heterogeneous polygons/stands, and
GPS PLGR error.
465 AA data points were collected during August 1998.
The weather at this time was unusually warm and
vegetation readily identifiable unless heavily grazed.
In the Park's North Unit, an extremely heavy growth of
yellow sweetclover was present over most grassland and
shrub communities. While noted during the AA sampling,
very little yellow sweetclover was present during the
previous year (1997), the year of aerial photography
acquisition and interpretation. AA points were collected
in proportion to the size of the plant association/ map
class within the Park; e.g. more points were collected
within extensive types.
