<abstract>The NW seagrass GIS data set was created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Biological Resources Division (BRD) at the National Wetlands Research Center (NWRC) in Lafayette, LA.  The study area is from Anclote Key to Perdido Bay on the Alabama-Florida state line.  The aerial photos were obtained in December of 1992 and early 1993.  Photos were 1:24,000 natural color.  Aerial photos were interpreted and delineated by USGS, then transferred to a base map using a zoom transfer scope.  The maps were digitized into ARC/INFO.  There are a few data gaps in the data set due to a lack of complete aerial photo coverage in the Panhandle region (West Bay and Escambia Bay).</abstract>
<purpose>To map spatial distribution of seagrasses in northwest Florida for scientific and GIS analysis.</purpose>
<supplinf>
Prior to July 1, 2004, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) was known as the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI). The institute name has not been changed in historical data sets or references to work completed by the Florida Marine Research Institute. The institute name has been changed in references to ongoing research, new research, and contact information.
Oysters and bare substrate were also mapped wherever they were found close to seagrasses. This is not intended to include a complete oyster reef data set. Despite being over ten years old, these are the best available seagrass data for this area.
(previous geoform was 'vector digital data')</supplinf>

<attraccr>Interpreted photos were quality checked by two photo interpreters for attribute classification. Field verification was performed for areas where attribute classification was questionable. Local personnel with state and federal agencies assisted in field identification. The mylar-based 1:24,000-scale maps were checked by cartographic personnel for line and labelworks. The attribute accuracy is tested manually comparing hard copy plots of the data with the source materials. When attributes cannot be visually verified on plots they are interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are compared against a master set of valid attributes.</attraccr>

These seagrass data were interpreted by the USGS National Wetlands Research Center in Lafayette, LA from 1:24000 scale natural color aerial photography flown in Nov '92.  Where data gaps occurred in portions of Pensacola Bay, Ft. Walton Beach and St. Andrews Bay, 1:32,500 scale color infrared photos flown in Dec '92 were used. The seagrass beds were classified according to a NWRC derived classification scheme based on the C-CAP Coastal Land Cover Classification system of NOAA Coastwatch Change Analysis Project.
Panhandle data were delivered to FWRI on a single CD-ROM containing ARC/INFO export files tiled into 7.5-minute quads.  Big Bend data were delivered as a single ARC/INFO coverage.  FWRI mapjoined the panhandle quads together.  Then the Panhandle and Big Bend coverages were mapjoined together.  Sliver polygons and edge matching errors were resolved at the border so boundary is invisible.
Please Note:  (2/4/2000)  The original data set from USGS has been changed.  Polys in the class "Estuarine (EST) Non-seagrass habitat (open water)" were changed to "Estuarine/Marine (EST/MAR) Non-seagrass habitat (open water)."  The reason for this change is that the original data from the USGS did not account for those waters having higher salinity values (Marine, ex. Gulf of Mexico) than those of estuarine environments.  The term "Estuarine"  indicates salinity values ranging from 10ppt - 30ppt, while Marine or Oceanic salinities may be greater than 30ppt.  Delineated photos were digitized in Arc/INFO by USGS Midcontinent Ecological Science Center.  The apparent data gap between Laguna Beach and Inlet Beach, FL was mapped but this coverage has not yet been received from USGS.  According to USGS, this area contained no seagrass.  Data for the 'west Pensacola' quad in upper Perdido Bay are missing.  FWRI never received this quad from USGS-NWRC for unknown reasons. For further information, see the 12 metadata textfiles supplied by USGS.
