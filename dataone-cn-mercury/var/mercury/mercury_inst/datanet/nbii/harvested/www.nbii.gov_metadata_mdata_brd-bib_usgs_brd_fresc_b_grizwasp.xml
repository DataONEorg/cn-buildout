<abstract>The consumption of wasps and bees by Yellowstone grizzly bears was investigated from data collected from 1977-1992 during a study of radio-marked bears.  Yellowstone grizzly bears are among only a few populations of their species in North America that consume wasps and bees in noteworthy amounts. Ground nests were located in or under logs and stumps in dense forest stands. Consumption was greatest during the drier months and years when abundant ungulate carrion and few whitebark pine seeds were available. This probably reflected an increase in wasp and bee populations and a decline of other food options. Little wasp and bee consumption during years when pine seeds were abundant probably reflects their preferred choice in the grizzly bear diet. Yellowstone grizzly bears apparently consumed wasps and bees most often when wasps and bees were most abundant and when other bear foods were scarce.</abstract>
