<descript>
<abstract>
Vegetation field plots at Mount Rushmore NM were visited, described, and
documented in a digital database. The database consists of 2 parts - (1)
Physical Descriptive Data, and (2) Species Listings .
</abstract>
<purpose>
Provide National Parks with the necessary tools to effectively manage
their natural resources. Plot data is collected and analyzed to develop a
classification (using the Standardized National Vegetation Classification
System) and description of vegetation types in preparation for
photointerpretation and mapping of the monument's vegetation types.

Physical description - Descriptive plot data were collected for 19 sites whose
vegetation represents a full spectrum of association types present within Mount
Rushmore National Memorial and its immediate surroundings. Attributes collected
for each site include: a unique plot identification code, park name, quad
name, UTM coordinates, UTM projection, plot survey date, surveyor's name,
length, width, photo type, elevation, slope aspect, topographic position,
landform, surface geology, Cowardin System category, hydrology, surface
material description, soil texture, soil drainage, leaf phenology, leaf
type, and physiognomy. Species - Descriptive plot data were collected for 19
sites whose vegetation represents a full spectrum of alliance types present
within Mount Rushmore National Memorial and its immediate surroundings. This
database which is the second of two databases containing plot field data,
delineates species. Individual species described at each of 19 plots is listed,
one line per species, with the following information: Plot Identification
Code, Species Name, Species Cover ( 0=trace, 1=&lt; 1%, 2=1-5%, 3=5-25%,
4=25-50%, 5=50-75%, 6=75-100%), Plantcode (first 2 letters of genus+first
2 letters of spp.), and Plant Strata (T, S, H, v.s, and no entry).
</attraccr>

<logic>
Physical description - Entries for each of the listed attributes are in the form
of consistent groupings of either textual or numerical descriptors. Species -
Entries for each of the listed attributes are in the form of consistent
groupings of either textual or numerical descriptors as described under
2.1.1: attribute accuracy report. NOTE1: The significance of numbers
appended to some of the Plant Codes is not known. NOTE2: entries under Plant
Strata were not clearly defined on the original field forms. It is assumed
that T=tree, S=shrub, and H=herbaceous. It is also assumed that numbers
represent canopy levels (starting with 1 as tallest), v.s. = very short.
Plant strata entries in this database are not always consistent with these
assumed labeling conventions.

The following describes the tasks performed by The Nature Conservancy to
produce descriptive data for 19 vegetation sampling plots in two separate
database files. Physical description - The first of the two contains general
descriptive information at each of the plots. Plot sites were selected by
information obtained during a reconnaissance visit to the park in April of
1995, and by examining tone and textural patterns on the MORU AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS.
Site physical parameters, species types, and vegetation strata were
described at each site. The PLOT DATA database contains tabulations of
site physical factors, listed under the ATTRIBUTE ACCURACY REPORT for each
of the 19 plots. Plot data were manually recorded on field forms on-site,
and subsequently keyed into the database files described herein.
Information in the plot database was then used to develop the
classification system and plant identification keys contained in the TNC
MORU SAMPLING AND CLASSIFICATION REPORT. Species - The second contains listings
of individual species found in each plot, along with cover estimates and height  (strata) delineations.
The SPECIES LISTING database contains line entries for
each species including the Plot Code, a unique numerical species code, full
species name, Species Cover, Plant Code, and Plant Strata delineation. See 2.1.1
(Accuracy Assessment Report) for explanations of these attributes. Plot
data were manually recorded on field forms on-site, and subsequently keyed
into the database files described herein. Information in the plot database
was then used to develop the classification system and plant
identification keys contained in the TNC MORU SAMPLING AND CLASSIFICATION
REPORT.

<eaover>
Each of 19 vegetation mapping plot sites has attributes of species found.
Physical description - General plot information is described by
identification codes, locational information (including state, park
name, and USGS 7 1/2' topographic quad name). Physical factors
tabulated in the database include UTM_X, UTM_Y, UTM Zone, map
projection, survey date, name of surveyors, plot length and
width, type of photos used, plot elevation, slope aspect, topographic
position, landform type, surface geology, Cowardin system descriptor,
hydrology, rock size, surface material type, soil texture and drainage,
leaf phenology, leaf type, and physiognomy. Species - (sp_code is a
project specific code for  each species found, species is the
scientific name for that  species, spcover is the species present and
the percent cover for each species, plant code is the first two letters
of the  genus and first two letters of the species. If the code are not
unique a number is added to make the code unique). This includes strata
cover  which is an average percent cover of that particular species,
1 = 0-10%, 2 = 10-25%, 3 = 25-60% and 4 = 60-100%,  pstrata is the type
of vegetation, T1 = emergent, T2 = canopy, T3  = sub-canopy, S1 = tall
shrub, S2 = short shrub, H = herbaceous, N = non-vascular, V = vine/liana,
and E = epiphyte).
