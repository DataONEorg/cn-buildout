<abstract>This GIS data set represents the Citrus and Hernando county shrimp closure area boundaries.</abstract>
<purpose>This data set visually represents Citrus and Hernando county shrimp closure areas. FWRI created these data at the request of the FWC Division of Marine Fisheries.</purpose>
<supplinf>
Prior to July 1, 2004, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) was known as the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI). The institute name has not been changed in historical data sets or references to work completed by the Florida Marine Research Institute. The institute name has been changed in references to ongoing research, new research, and contact information.
Florida Administrative Code (FAC) chapter 68B-38.001 describes the regulation of these zones as follows:
(3) No person shall operate any trawl in the following zones during the time periods indicated:
(a) ZONES I and III - Beginning on October 5 of each year and continuing through May 20 of the following year.
(b) ZONE IV - Beginning on December 2 of each year and continuing through April 1 of the following year.
(c) ZONE V - Beginning on December 1 of each year and continuing through March 15 of the following year.
(4) No person shall fish with, set, or place any trap in the following zones during the time periods indicated:
(a) ZONE II - Beginning on October 5 of each year and continuing through May 20 of the following year.
(b) ZONE IV - Beginning on October 5 of each year and continuing through December 1 of the same year and beginning on April 2 of each year and continuing through May 20 of the same year.
(c) ZONE V - Beginning on October 5 of each year and continuing through November 30 of the same year and beginning on March 16 of each year and continuing through May 20 of the same year.
(5) This rule shall not be construed as allowing shrimping or trapping in areas or during times as may be otherwise prohibited by law or rule.
(6) "Trawl" means a net in the form of an elongated bag with the mouth kept open by various means and fished by being towed or dragged on the bottom.
(7) "Trapping" means deployment of any device for harvesting crabs, fish, or other animals, which device captures by entrapping such animals within its walls, including, but not limited to any trap authorized in Rules 68B-13.008, 68-14.005, 68B-24.006, or 68B-45.004, or in Section 370.1105, Florida Statutes.
See the FAC for the official bounding coordinates of these zones.
