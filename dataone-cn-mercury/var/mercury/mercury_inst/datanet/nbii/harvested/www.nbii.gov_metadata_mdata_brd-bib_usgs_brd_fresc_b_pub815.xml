<abstract>Chlorophyll concentrations were examined in unstratified ponds and stratified lakes in Mount Rainier National Park (MORA), and compared to clear, deep lakes in the Oregon Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada Range.  Near-surface and near-bottom samples were collected over the deepest part of  32 MORA ponds and 14 MORA lakes between 1992 and 1996.  At Mowich Lake, the deepest MORA lake (Z=58.6 m), seven depths were sampled between the surface and 50m.  While chlorophyll concentrations were generally low, they were higher in ponds than in lakes.  This may be due to increased nutrient availability from interactions at the mud-water interface in ponds, and animal waste from elk which used many ponds as wallows.  In lakes, chlorophyll concentrations were higher in hypolimnetic samples than in epilimnetic samples. In Mowich Lake, the chlorophyll maximum was near the lake bottom.  In clear, deep lakes in the Oregon Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada Range the hypolimnetic chlorophyll maximum commonly occurs between the depth of 1.0-0.1% surface incident light.  At MORA, Secchi disk clarity readings indicated that the depth of 1.0% surface incident light exceeded the depth of ponds and lakes.  In the non-MORA clear, deep lakes, where the depth of 1.0% incident light does not exceed lake maximum depth, the hypolimnetic chlorophyll maximum typically occurs at depths between 75 to 140 m.</abstract>
