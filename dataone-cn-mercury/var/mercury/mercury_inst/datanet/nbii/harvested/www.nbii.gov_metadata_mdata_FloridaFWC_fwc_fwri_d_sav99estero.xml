<abstract>This GIS data set was produced for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission&amp;#146;s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) in partnership with the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD).  This data set consists of digital data describing the seagrass, unvegetated bottom, open water, algal beds, oysters, and apparent shoreline for the Southwest Florida Seagrass project area, which consists of Pine Island Sound, Matlacha Pass, San Carlos Bay, the lower Caloosahatchee River, and Estero Bay, in 1999.</abstract>
<purpose>The intended use of this GIS data set is to provide mapped documentation of the extent and distribution of seagrass communities within the Southwest Florida Seagrass project area in 1999.</purpose>
<supplinf>Prior to July 1, 2004, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) was known as the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI). The institute name has not been changed in historical data sets or references to work completed by the Florida Marine Research Institute. The institute name has been changed in references to ongoing research, new research, and contact information.  (previous geoform was 'vector digital data')</supplinf>

Experienced quality control photointerpreters performed a 100% quality control check, in stereo, of all delineations produced during the photointerpretation process to check for accuracy of delineations and classifications.
The first photointerpretation quality control review was an in-process review performed on the analytical stereoplotter.  A quality control photointerpreter reviewed the seagrass delineations interpreted on the aerial photographs (these data existed as a .dgn file at that stage of production).  Baymont possesses a Zeiss analytical stereoplotter with dual optics, which allowed two photointerpreters to view the images simultaneously.  This equipment is typically used for quality assurance reviews.  Suggested corrections were pointed out to the original photointerpreter during the in-process quality control review.  Some suggested corrections warranted further investigation in the field so that selected classification problems (particularly algae vs. seagrass) could be positively resolved.
Baymont also performed fieldwork in order to assess and maintain the quality of all photointerpretation. The trips accomplished several photointerpretation tasks in unison including 1) signature identification in advance of photointerpretation; 2) resolution of problems encountered during photointerpretation and 3) ground-truthing of existing delineations by comparing those delineations to the conditions in the field.
In addition, hard copy photo scale plots of all QC'd delineations were sent to FWRI for further review comments by their staff.  These review comments were inspected and responded to by the Baymont QC team.
Accuracy of valid attributes was also verified using QC steps in ARC/INFO.

<logic>Microstation .dgn files were imported to ARC/Info to perform automated validation routines.  Quality control checks for digital data consisted of unlabeled, multi-labeled and contiguous polygon errors as well as dangles and sliver polygons.  Polygon topology was created and label errors and node errors were run in ARC/Info.  Coverage characteristics were adhered to, as specified by the contract (tolerances, projection definition, PAT items etc.).</logic>

The data originated from Aerial photography flown in December 1999.
The data set includes an ArcInfo coverage that was digitized from 1:24000-scale natural color aerial photographs that were photogrammetrically georeferenced utilizing GPS ground control points. Data was stereoscopically photointerpreted and digitized using a Zeiss P3 analytical stereoplotter. The seagrass beds and additional categories were classified according to the FDOT Florida Land Use, Cover and Forms Classification System (FLUCCS). Minimum mapping unit (mmu) for all classes was 0.25 acres. A Photointerpretation Key was developed to aid in the classification of collected data. Ground-truthing was performed during the photointerpretation phase to ensure classification accuracy and consistency of PI. Digital files were created in Microstation design file format (.dgn). 1999 SWIM Seagrass data was translated from ARC/Info to .dgn format and was referenced as collateral tie information during the compilation process.
