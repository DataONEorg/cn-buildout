<abstract>
The state of Virginia, in cooperation with the US
EPA Chesapeake Bay Program, has monitored
phytoplankton primary production in the Virginia
Chesapeake Bay mainstem and tributaries since July
1989. The program is designed to give
comprehensive spatial and temporal information  on
primary production.  Sampling is performed in
conjunction with the Maryland phytoplankton,
fluorometry, mesozooplankton, microzooplankton,
jellyfish and water quality monitoring programs.
</abstract>
<purpose>
The overall phytoplankton monitoring program is
designed to detect and monitor changes in plankton
production in relation to changing water quality
conditions in Chesapeake Bay.

Standard protocol procedures will be followed to
guard against errors and maintain accuracy and
precision throughout the collection and analysis
procedures (Strickland and Parsons, 1972).  These
include first hand instruction to all assistants
by the re-check and first hand observations by the
Principle Investigator., and periodic duplicate
analysis of samples collected.  The C14 work will
be performed on four separate replicates taken
from each composite sample.  Carbonate alkalinity
will be determined on four separate replicates.
Comparison between replicates will be constantly
monitored. The phytoplankton field chief was the
custodian for all samples collected, and verifies
proper labeling of bottles, complete field data
entries, the collection of the samples,
preservative used and transport to the laboratory.
He also supervised the calibration and
availability of field equipment. Samples were
turned over to the laboratory chief who oversees
the sample processing, analysis and recording of
the raw data.  Taxon identifications, raw data
sheets and other stages of the collection and
analysis procedures are routinely checked by the
principal investigator and laboratory chief for
quality assurance. All stations positions are
provided as NAD27 coordinates.

Sampling in the Elizabeth River did not begin
until February of 1991. In 1998, sampling at
Elizabeth River Station SBE2 was discontinued and
a second sampling cruise was added in July and
August for all remaining stations.

Carbon fixation rates (C14) were obtained from
replicate surface layer composite samples at 15
stations, sampled monthly from January - December
in Virginia.  Stations were located to
characterize primary productivity in the lower Bay
and Bay mouth systems, Virginia Tributaries and
Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River.  Sampling
in the Elizabeth River did not begin until
February of 1991. In 1998, sampling at Elizabeth
River Station SBE2 was discontinued and a second
sampling cruise was added in July and August for
all remaining stations.

In the laboratory, a one hundred milliliter
samples from each composite sample were placed in
separate dilution bottles and transferred to a
water bath equipped with a bottle holder which
rotates between banks of cool-white fluorescent
lights. The light levels exceeded the light
saturation point of the phytoplankton. The
temperature of the water bath was the same as the
temperature at each station when the samples were
taken. After one hour of acclamation the bottles
were inoculated with two to five uCi  C14-NaHCO3.
The samples were returned to the water bath for
one hour.  One of the samples was analyzed for C14
activity immediately (zero Time of Sample). At the
end of the incubation period (one and half to two
hours) the remaining samples was filtered through
a 25 mm 0.45 pore-size millipore filter under a
vacuum less than 5 cm Hg pressure. After the
contents of the milk dilution bottle and its
rinses were filtered, the Millipore filters were
removed and fumed over concentrated HCl for 30
seconds and placed in scintillation vials.
Scintillation fluid was added to each vial and C14
activity was determined using a Beckman Model LS
1701scintillation counter. The amount of C14 in
the stock bottle was determined by placing 20 to
50 microliter of stock solution in scintillation
vials containing 0.5 milli- liters of
phenethylamine.  Scintillation fluid was added to
the vials set in the dark over night and analyzed
for C14 activity.

The following equations were used to determine the
rate of carbon fixation in ug/l/hr.  Note that the
raw data used in these calculations are not
presented in the associated data set.  Only the
resulting carbon fixation rate is included.    1)

Carbon fixation rate in ug C/l/hr; IVOL = Volume

this ratio is calculated prior to rounding the
CARBFIX value where ASMRATIO = Assimilation ratio;
CARBFIX = Carbon fixation in ug C/l/h from 2);
