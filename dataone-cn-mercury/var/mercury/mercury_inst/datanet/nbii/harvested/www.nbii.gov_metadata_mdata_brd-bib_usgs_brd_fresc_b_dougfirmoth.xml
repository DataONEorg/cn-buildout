<abstract>The Northwest Forest Plan requires that federal land managers monitor the effectiveness of their management actions. However, little work has been done in the Pacific Northwest to document how biodiversity and trophic relationships vary between young (thinned and unthinned) and old forest stands. One portion of a recently completed USGS funded project emphasized the impact of different ecological situations (e.g., vegetation type, disturbance, stage of succession) and forest management practices (e.g., thinning, burning, grazing, pesticides) on the biodiversity of moths. A USGS partner at Oregon State University, Jeffrey Miller, used ultraviolet blacklight traps to assess effects of forest management on communities of moths. In the dynamics of forested ecosystems, moths play a critical role by functioning as defoliators, decomposers, prey or hosts to carnivores, and pollinators.  The results identified six moth species as indicators of old growth forests, six moth species as indicators of clearcut treatments, and two moth species as indicators of thinned treatments.  In addition, it was concluded that flowering trees and shrubs provide a large majority of the required caterpillar host plants that make up the overall moth diversity in all the forest types studied.</abstract>
