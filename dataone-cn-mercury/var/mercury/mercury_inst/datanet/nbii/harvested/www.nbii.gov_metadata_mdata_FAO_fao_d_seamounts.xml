<abstract>SeamountsOnline is an NSF-funded project that holds records of species that have been collected from underwater seamounts, guyots and ridges, along with some accessory information about when, where and how the samples were collected.  The contents of SeamountsOnline is constantly growing as we find and incorporate new sources of data.  At present, the system holds 5124 records on 1348 species and 86 seamounts.</abstract>
<purpose>The purpose of Seamounts Online is to gather information on species found in seamount habitats, and to provide a freely-available online resource for searching, downloading, mapping, and analyzing patterns of biogeography in these data. It is designed to facilitate research into seamount ecology, and to act as a resource for managers.</purpose>
<supplinf>Information was obtained from http://seamounts.sdsc.edu/. In the course of developing SeamountsOnline, over 1,000 literature citations have been collected relating to seamounts. The coverage is most comprehensive for biological sampling on seamounts. Geology, hydrology, chemistry, etc. are also represented, but the coverage is not as thorough. The bibliography can be searched for references of interest or downloaded as whole through the Search References feature.  (previous geoform was 'Database')</supplinf>

<datacred>Current staff include Karen Stocks, the principal investigator, with a leg in both the worlds of oceanography and ecological informatics; David Stockwell, an information scientist and developer of ecological analyses tools at the San Diego Supercomputer Center; Lisa Levin, a biological oceanographer in the Marine Life Research Group at Scripps Institute of Oceanography; Elisheba Spiller, an environmental systems student at UCSD, has taken over data content development.  Previous staff included  John Lin, a computer science major student at UCSD who developed the website and Megan Williams, an environmental science major at UCSD, was in charge of data acquisition and entry until her graduation in Spring of 2002.  Our thanks to those who have provided data for the SeamountsOnline project. Our "Hall of Champions" includes: Bertram Richer de Forges and collaborators for their Norfolk Ridge data; George Boehlert for his ichthyoplankton dataset; Heino Fock and collaborators for their Great Meteor Fish data; FishBase, an online resource of fish distribution, taxonomy and life history data (www.fishbase.org). FishBase kindly allowed SeamountsOnline to access and download seamount-related records. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography's seamount related records from the Marine Vertebrates and Benthic Invertebrate collections (http://www.sio.ucsd.edu/library/collections.htm).</datacred>

<attracc>
<attraccr>Seamounts, like all open ocean habitats, are understudied. In order to interpret the species distribution patterns found within the dataset it is vital to concurrently consider the sampling information. Many seamounts have not been sampled, and those that have may have records for only one or a few taxonomic groups from one or a few sampling events. If a particular species has not been recorded for a particular seamount, it may be that the species does not occur there, but it may well also be that the species is present but has not been found in the existing sampling. This database records species presences, but does not indicate where a species is absent. Instead, we provide as complete sampling information as possible to allow the user to assess for him or herself whether the lack of an observation is due to undersampling or a true absence.</attraccr>

The database has strong coverage (5/2002) for benthic, near-bottom invertebrates and fish on the Nasca/Sala-y-Gomez chain off Peru, benthic, near-bottom invertebrates and fish from  the Norfolk ridge in the Coral Sea and pelagic and benthic decapods, fishes and mollusks from the Hawaii/Emperor Chain and Mid-Pacific Mountains.</complete>

<othercit>This covers data from a series of Soviet/Russian Expeditions.  Bottom and off-bottom sampling, including trawls, traps and long-lines give comprehensive community information on all invertebrate and vertebrate taxa found.  Overall, ~1000 records of 388 species from 22 seamounts are included.  The sampling effort per seamount is not known at present.  For more information, please see:  Parin, Mironov, and Nesis, Advances in Marine Biology 32, pp 145-242, 1997.</othercit>

<ordering>Data can be downloaded 3 ways - species data only, species with sample data, or sample data only.  Species data - only downloads the species, location, and reference information.  Species Data with Sample Data - downloads the species data file on screen, with additional columns holding complete sample information for each observation (i.e. the gear used, the expedition name, dates collected, etc.). Note that this can be unwieldy when you have queried for all species from a given seamount: if a sample had 50 species in it, the full details of the sample will be repeated in 50 rows, once for each species. However, it is convenient in that all the data are in a single, stand-alone file.  Separate Sample Data - downloads a comma-delimited text file containing the full information (i.e. the gear used, the expedition name, dates collected, Esc) for each sample referenced in the on-screen table of species. This is designed to act as a companion to the Species Data file, and contains the same sample information in the "Species Data with Sample Data" version. This can be more convenient than the combined "Species Data with Sample Data" file in that each sample is listed only once. The two files are cross-referenced through the Sample ID field.</ordering>
