Contained herein are integration tests to be used with
the Hudson automated test harness.  The scripts are Perl-
based, and use modules found in CPAN, thus operate under
the GPL license.

Additionally, these tests can be run outside the Hudson
environment, either using the shell scripts, that put the
results in JUnit format, or the test_[[someTest]].pl scripts
themselves, which produce TAP output (a standard test format
Perl uses for module installs).

The script that converts TAP output to JUnit output is a freely
distributable program "tap-tp-junit-xml.pl") obtained online.
Attribution and license terms contained in the script itself.

The suite of tests make use of several CPAN modules distributed 
under the GPL.  These need to be installed separately on the
machine running the tests.
